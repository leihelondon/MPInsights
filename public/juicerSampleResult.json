Bobbi's family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off her life support yesterday and are now planning her funeral.\n\nHowever, friends and family of Nick fear he \"could take his own life\" after learning of the tragic news. A source close to him told US website, HollywoodLife.com: \"His emotions are out of control right now. Nick is on suicide watch, he is out of control and with regret and sadness.\n\nNick, 25, is said to believe he thinks Bobbi Kristina could have survived if she'd heard his voice\n\n\"He keeps saying that if only (Bobbi Kristina) had heard his voice, things would have been different. She may have lived.\" Relations between Nick and Bobbi Kristina's family have allegedly been strained ever since she was found unconscious at the house they shared in Atlanta on January 31. Earlier this month, Nick was served with a $10 million lawsuit by Bobbi Kristina's conservators, accused of physically assaulting her and stealing thousands of dollars of her money.\n\nIt's unsure when Nick last visited Bobbi Kristina in hospital, and he's thought not to have seen her at all after she was moved to Peachtree Christian Hospice, which she was transferred to on June 24. Yesterday, a spokesperson confirmed her death, saying: \"Bobbi Kristina Brown passed away July, 26 2015, surrounded by her family. She is finally at peace in the arms of God. \"We want to again thank everyone for their tremendous amount of love and support during these last few months.\"",

Nick and our family are in mourning, and we ask that you respect our privacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with both the Houstons and the Browns during this difficult time.”\n\nWhitney Houston and Bobby Brown’s only daughter was surrounded by her family when she passed away at Peachtree Christian Hospice in Duluth, Ga., Sunday after spending nearly six months in a medically induced coma.\n\nAfter her mother’s death in 2012, Bobbi Kristina inherited an estate estimated to be worth nearly $115 million. In the years that followed, the singer’s daughter would often appear “under the influence” near her home in Roswell, Ga. in a perceived effort to numb the pain of her loss, according to eyewitnesses.",

Hargrove confirmed that ‘no stone’ will be left unturned ‘in seeking justice for Bobbi Kristina Brown’.\n\nBedelia had previously filed a complaint against Nick in June alleging him of ‘domestic abuse and stealing money’ but the amended complaint now fully puts the blame for Bobbi’s death on Nick.\n\n‘I am deeply saddened by the recent death of Bobbi Kristina Brown. I extend my sincerest condolences to all of her family. Consistent with and to the letter of the civil action I initially filed on behalf of Bobbi Kristina, we will continue to pursue justice for her,’ Bedelia told People magazine in a statement.\n\n‘I have filed today an amended complaint against Nicholas Gordon adding a count for wrongful death and for pain and suffering. We will leave no stone unturned in seeking justice for Bobbi Kristina Brown.’\n\nBobbi, the only child of Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston sadly passed away on July 26 2015. She had been placed in a medically-induced coma on January 31 after being found face-down in the bath at her home by Nick and a friend.\n\nBobbi was found with bruises on her face and body, swollen lips and a missing tooth, however the autopsy concluded that there were no ‘obvious underlying cause of death and no significant injuries were noted’.\n\nNick’s legal team replied to the complaint, hitting back and telling People that ‘the recent lawsuit against Nick is slanderous and meritless.\n\n‘Nick has been heartbroken and destroyed over the loss of his love and it’s shameful that such baseless allegations have been presented publicly.’\n\nThe statement came from Joe Habachy and Jose Baez who added: ‘Nick has engaged civil counsel and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously and expose it for what it is: a fictitious assault against the person who loved Krissy most.’\n\nMORE: Chilling Bobbi Kristina deathbed photo has been printed by the National Enquirer\n\nMORE: Bobbi Kristina Brown’s funeral marred by family tensions as her aunt Leolah ‘ejected’ from service\n\nMORE: Bobbi Kristina Brown is laid to rest as family continue their ongoing feud",

Nick is on suicide watch, he is out of control and with regret and sadness.\n\n\"He keeps saying that if only (Bobbi Kristina) had heard his voice, things would have been different.
