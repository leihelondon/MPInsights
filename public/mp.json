    {"label":"Bridget Phillipson","value":"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Gray. I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck) on securing this important debate.The Tyne and Wear Metro is a critical part of the north-east&#8217;s transport infrastructure. For decades it has provided high levels of service punctuality and customer satisfaction running millions of journeys every year to ensure that the people of the north-east could get around quickly and efficiently. I am concerned to hear so many of the points raised by my hon. Friends today regarding the drop in operating performance. Valid concerns have been raised. Journeys are being affected by the age and need for upkeep of the rolling stock in use. Punctuality performance during the period of DB Regio&#8217;s operation has declined significantly: it is on average 8% lower than this time last year. Many travellers have also complained that when things go wrong there is no information about what is happening and few viable alternative means of completing their journey.I hope that as a result of today&#8217;s debate progress can be made to ensure that the Metro provides a reliable and affordable service. However the Government have a role to play in ensuring that the Metro can meet its targets. One way to ensure that Nexus meets the plans it published last year in its &#8220;Metro Strategy 2030&#8221; document is for the Government to provide the funding necessary to secure a new fleet. This would reduce the number of technical issues that have arisen as a result of the 40-year-old rolling stock. We need upgrades to be carried out.We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson) about the need to extend the Metro to Washington. That is certainly something that my constituents would support. The re-opening of the Leamside line would benefit many people across Sunderland. Another proposed extension is the new line that would run from Doxford International business park in my constituency. This would transform transport links in my area giving local people rapid access to other parts of the city and the wider region and it would allow local businesses to grow and create jobs through improved transport links.The people in Houghton and Sunderland South deserve to see real improvements. The north-east continues to get a raw deal on public transport investment compared with other parts of the country. In London when things go wrong commuters have a wealth of options available but when we have a problem on one part of the network in Tyne and Wear there is a knock-on effect. In the north-east when there is a problem with the Metro or when local buses do not run passengers can be left stranded.If the Government are serious about creating a so-called northern powerhouse in the north-east to drive economic growth they must match their rhetoric with action and invest to create a truly integrated transport network. Joining up the Metro local buses and other transport options will give passengers genuine choice as to how they travel and options when things go wrong. It will also help commuters get to work improve transport links for businesses and spur job creation.Of course our capital city needs investment in the rail network to ensure it can function properly so that we can attract jobs and investment but so does the north-east. Unfortunately in recent weeks we have had further confirmation that the Government remain lacking in commitment when it comes to investment in transport infrastructure in the north. In my constituency we do not benefit at all from the Tyne and Wear Metro. Many people use it but we do not have direct links within the constituency and for many of my constituents the only option is bus travel. That is why I have campaigned so much to support what the combined authority has done on introducing a quality contract scheme.If businesses are to continue to invest in the region and jobs are to be created we need a more integrated network. We need a joined-up network so that people can be confident of getting to work on time and so that businesses know that they can invest in an area with excellent transport links. The north-east has many excellent road networks and good links in many respects but we are let down by public transport. The proposed Metro extension to Doxford is absolutely critical and I hope to see the extension proposals in &#8220;Metro Strategy 2030&#8221; become a reality.I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response. I want to hear him outline the work that he will do through the Department to make sure that the Metro receives the investment it needs in the short term and how he will work with Nexus and the combined authority to deliver the long-term investment in transport infrastructure that the north-east needs particularly the investment needed over the next 20 to 30 years to extend the Metro and offer better transport options for the region to support the businesses job creation and growth that we all want to see.Time is short so I will try to get through my remarks as quickly as possible. There is huge potential in the north-east for economic growth but if the past five years have taught us anything it is that our region is experiencing disproportionate funding cuts. We need a fairer deal from the Government this time around. Any talk of regional devolution has to go hand in hand with action to address that unfair funding imbalance.Although I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s belated recognition that the north does not end at Manchester or Leeds by incorporating the north-east in his plans his proposed settlement on devolution for our region is deeply flawed. Devolution should mean empowering local regions to decide how best to spend their resources in order to nurture economic growth. Indeed he has promised to give local authorities the levers they need to grow their local economy and ensure that local people keep the rewards but under his current proposals only areas with a directly elected mayor will be given such levers. Devolution by diktat seems a strange form of empowerment to me.The Government may believe that directly elected mayors represent the best means of ensuring accountability on devolved decision making but Ministers have yet fully to make the case for why they believe that to be true. I am sceptical about whether local voters will agree with them. People in the north-east should be given the opportunity to make that decision for themselves. Forcing them to accept devolution on the Government&#8217;s terms is not devolution at all.Sunderland and Newcastle have previously rejected directly elected Mayors in referendums. The 2004 regional assembly referendum was very clear. If that opposition remains why should the north-east and the communitiesI represent be denied the benefits that devolution will bring especially as the North East combined authority has made significant progress in a short space of time not least on local transport matters? Plans to re-regulate local buses are under way through the quality contract scheme a change for which I have long campaigned and that I have long supported.I welcome the hon. Member for Stockton South (James Wharton) to his new role and I am pleased that he at least has recognised that a one-size-fits-all approach to the devolution of regional powers is flawed. But if as he says the so-called northern powerhouse is not a proposal to force a uniform model on everyone why has the Chancellor gone on the record as saying that he will settle for nothing less than elected mayors? Which is it? If the Government are serious about creating an economic powerhouse that encapsulates all of the north local people must be given freedom to determine their own destiny free from prescription or interference from Whitehall. The Government&#8217;s proposals in their current form will deny the people of the north-east that opportunity.I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate. With two thirds of all public transport journeys made by bus we are right to talk more about the importance of local bus services although the issue is often overshadowed by debate on rail and infrastructure. Unfortunately my constituents do not enjoy the benefits of a rail or light rail service and many are entirely reliant on local bus services. I hear from older residents who are left cut off and isolated unable easily to access GP or hospital appointments from shift workers who simply cannot get to work and from employers who find it difficult to retain staff as a result. Families who are still struggling to make ends meet face above inflation fare rises year on year.In 2010 I first began to campaign on the issue when local parents asked for my help to try to protect a route that had served the community for decades but whichwas about to be cut making it difficult for their children to get to school. Despite the fact that operators receive more than 40% of their income from the taxpayer local people found that they had little to no say. The operator made it clear that although we could raise our concerns it was under no legal obligation even to consult on changes.The decision to deregulate local bus services in the 1980s is the primary reason for the poor state of bus services in Tyne and Wear and my constituency. The Transport Act 1985 did not deliver on its promise to increase the use of public transport bring in lower fares and lower the cost to the taxpayer. Instead in the north-east a small number of operators cherry-pick the most profitable routes and set the fare structure and bus timetables with little or no regard for integration or best value for the passenger and taxpayer. The 1985 Act marked the beginning of a great divide in our country between areas of regulated and deregulated local bus services. Since bus services were deregulated outside London the two different systems have produced very different outcomes in passenger growth. Figures show that since deregulation passenger journeys on local bus services outside London have fallen by 37% whereas in London bus patronage has increased by 105%. In Tyne and Wear the position could not be clearer. Deregulation has failed: fares go up above inflation pricing people off buses; routes are cut and needlessly changed; and whole areas are left cut off.An investigation in 2011 by the Competition Commission was highly critical of deregulated bus services. It found limited competition between operators which tended to result in higher fares and lower quality for passengers. The report also found that head-to-head competition for services was unlikely because of the dominance of a small number of operators. In fact there was heavy criticism because some bus companies were accused of colluding to avoid direct competition altogether resulting in geographic market segregation including in my area.Last month in Tyne and Wear the north-east combined authority voted to press ahead with the quality contract scheme. This will create a level playing field and allow new entrants to break into the market. Part of the profits made will be reinvested into improving local services and reducing the subsidies paid by local taxpayers while at the same time increasing passenger numbers. Over a decade this will result in &#163;272 million in economic benefits to the region. There will be a simple fare structure with Oyster-style integrated ticketing. Fare rises will be capped with extra help for families with children.For three years the bus operators have been scaremongering about the prospect of a quality contract scheme in Tyne and Wear. Stagecoach&#8217;s Brian Souter claims that those of us who want a better local bus service are &#8220;unreconstructed Stalinists&#8221; and has threatened to pull out of the region altogether. Stagecoach is however happy to run services under London&#8217;s regulated system and there is no good reason why it could not do the same in Tyne and Wear. This is typical of the bluster and the negative campaign of scaremongering that has characterised its opposition to change. It has frequently threatened legal action in the hope that it could bully councillors into giving in. Its threats have so far failed but it has not gone away. It istime the operators respected this democratic decision and contemplated exactly why it is that people are so dissatisfied and so angry with the service it offers.Where Tyne and Wear is leading the way I want other areas and cities to follow. Even the Chancellor now appears to accept this case. Today however the Secretary of State has unfortunately refused to back the decision of the North East combined authority. In fact in the past four years his Department has repeatedly failed to do so. What should the people in the north-east take from that? Surely if it is good enough for Greater Manchester it is good enough for us in Tyne and Wear too where local councils have come together to work to deliver better value and a better system for the taxpayer? The quality contract scheme has been a long drawn out and complex process. I am pleased that the shadow Secretary of State has made it clear we should simplify the process and avoid vested interests being able to frustrate it.The north-east has so much to offer but there are many challenges ahead with the highest rate of unemployment and some of the lowest paid workers in the country. We have the capacity to make a greater contribution to the nation&#8217;s economy but we need a transport network that supports businesses growth and job creation. Today&#8217;s motion and the quality contract scheme we are pressing ahead with in Tyne and Wear is the change that our region needs to take that forward.It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Caton and I am grateful for having secured this debate.The north-east is a wonderful place for us to live work and do business. However too many of our constituents are struggling and central Government are not giving us the support that we need. On so many economic measures we are falling behind the rest of the country. From May to July 2014 the north-east had the highest UK unemployment rate; it stood at 9.9% compared with the average of 6.2%. The north-east has some of the lowest-paid workers in the country and the average salary was nearly &#163;3000 below the UK average in 2013. We have seen the slowest percentage increase in wage growth of anywhere in the UK. Since 2010 wages in the north-east have fallen by over &#163;1200 a year in real terms.This is not because the north-east has less to offer; quite the opposite. We are the only English region with a trade surplus. We have world-class universities and global links through air and sea. It is important however that the north-east gets its fair share of funding. The economic challenges we face are tough and it is clear that we need additional support from Government in tackling them yet our councils have seen disproportionate cuts to their budgets with funding shifted to more affluent areas. Improving transport is an important way of addressing some of the problems that we face. Lord Adonis&#8217;s review cited the World Bank demonstrating that infrastructure including transport is a key element of an enabling environment for economic growth. We can support growth and job creation if we have an efficient public transport system. Jobseekers need to be able to get to interviews and to work and should not have to spend hours or even their hourly wage doing so. The north-east has the capacity to make a greater contribution to our economic recovery but we need Government to work with us. Improvement and investment in our transport systems will help to deliver that contribution.The north-east is a wonderfully diverse place and my constituency is made up of the urban and the semi-rural&#8212;of towns villages and estates. Given that diversity the transport needs of constituents differ widely. However the north-east receives the lowest level of Government funding for transport. Every region deserves excellent transport services but our needs in the north-east are not reflected in the funding that we receive. Government figures show that public expenditure on transport in the north-east has decreased year on year since 2010. In 2012-13 &#163;554 million was spent on transport in thenorth-east compared with over &#163;4.5 billion in London and 2.9% of overall UK spend is in the north-east compared with 24% in London.The 2011 census shows that both London and the north-east have the lowest number of car owners in the country. Both regions are clearly full of people who rely on local transport services to get around yet both regions do not enjoy the same high level of service. One reason for that is disproportionate funding. The Scottish referendum campaign reinforced a point that many of us have argued for years. We need to ensure that all parts of the United Kingdom benefit from and contribute to our economic recovery. Economic growth and value must not depend on London and the south-east. It is right that we continue to push for further investment outside London to grow the economy in a balanced and sustainable way.Funding is not the only explanation for the difference in services between London and the north-east however. In London an accountable transport authority is able to make important decisions on fares and routes and to ensure that the transport needs of passengers and communities are met in the capital. In my constituency we do not enjoy the benefit of a rail link or light-rail link. Many people are entirely dependent on local bus services which is why I have been campaigning on the issue since my election. I have heard from many local people that they are concerned about high bus fares poor timetables and infrequent services. Older residents tell me how difficult it can be to get to hospital and that they are cut off and isolated in the evenings as they are unable to leave their homes. That situation simply cannot continue.Next week the North East combined authority will decide whether to introduce a quality contract scheme in Tyne and Wear. I am calling on its members to press ahead and make the change that we need. The new system would have routes set by the transport authority with bus operators bidding to run services in an open competition. Not only would we see real competition for the first time but we would have a simple fare system with Oyster-style ticketing under which average annual fare increases would be no more than the retail prices index. I am not opposed to bus operators making a profit but I do question the excessive profits made by companies such as Stagecoach in the region. I want some of that profit to be reinvested in the region and to go on subsidising services and ensuring that my constituents can get to work hospital and their places of training and education.I understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s concern but I do not share his conclusion. I am sure that he will make his case strongly to the leaders of the combined authority. I am confident that the proposal will secure the long-term future of our bus network in Tyne and Wear and in the wider region in the longer term. I understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s concerns and am sure that he will set them out in greater detail.Profit cannot be the sole priority for a public bus service. Competition can be an important way to ensure low fares and improve services. However the existing system of deregulated bus services is broken. An investigation in 2011 by the Competition Commission was highly critical of deregulated bus services. It found that there was limited competition between operators which tended to result in higher prices and lower quality for passengers. The report also found that head-to-head competition for services was unlikely between dominant operators. There was heavy criticism because some bus companies were accused of colluding to avoid direct competition entirely which resulted in geographic market segregation. As in the energy market a small number of companies dominate the bus market in the region. A quality contract scheme would create a level playing field allowing new entrants to break into the market. It would also deliver better value for taxpayers and passengers alike.I constantly hear from local people who struggle to get to work easily especially shift workers in places such as Doxford international business park where many thousands are based. The recently announced Metro strategy 2030 set out ambitious plans to develop Tyne and Wear&#8217;s Metro system with the potential to include Doxford park in the long term. Current predictions estimate 5.4 million passenger trips per annum by 2030 on the South Shields to Sunderland to Doxford line but any extension would of course depend on government support. The plan recognises both the importance of the business hub to our local economy and the need for regular and high-quality transport links to and from work. The proposal forms part of a comprehensive plan to improve transport in our region. The Metro Strategy 2030 includes a proposal to bring part of the Leamside line back into use. The North East local enterprise partnership has commissioned a study into the business case for reopening the line and has identified improving links within the region as one of its key priorities. Long-term investment is important but next Tuesday one part of the solution to our transport needs is within our grasp.I am grateful to EDF based at Doxford for recently conducting a staff survey on public transport. In the survey 38% of respondents felt that services to Doxford park were either very poor or poor value for money 40% felt that services had either very poor or poor frequency during the day and a shocking 62% felt that frequency during the night was either very poor or poor. One respondent noted that bus prices were so high that it was cheaper to use a car with another being forced to catch three buses to get home if their shift finished after 8 pm. I visited EE which is also based at Doxford and found that many of its staff face the same challenges. I heard that those whose shifts finish at 8 pm literally run out the door to catch the last bus or face a long wait. Others must come to work far earlier than their shift start time because unless they catch the hourly bus service they risk the consequences of being late. Obviously that risks impacting on staff retention. That is not good enough. Visitors and staff at Doxford Park make an important contribution to our local economy and they should be able to expect a fair reliable and efficient bus service.In 2011 Government cuts meant that the 3&#189;-mile Sunderland central route had to be scrapped. The scheme would have eased congestion and improved access to Rainton Bridge business park. The loss of the scheme was hugely disappointing and was made all the worse by the lack of alternative transport options for the staff there. The scrapping of the route has had a significant effect on traffic in the surrounding area and on local residents who live nearby.I have been continually disappointed by the bus companies&#8217; attitude to improving services for their passengers. The voluntary agreement that the bus companies are supporting would result in severe cuts to publicly funded bus services and to support for non-statutory fares therefore falling far short of what is necessary. Bus companies are refusing to listen to their customers&#8217; concerns choosing instead to redirect routes that customers rely on make meaningless changes to route names and numbers and to bus branding and embark on a systematic campaign of scaremongering. Bus companies appear more concerned with threatening legal action than dealing with cuts to services and rising fares.Yesterday morning I received an e-mail from Go North East seeking to acquaint me with what it sees as the facts on a quality contract scheme. Go North East claims that customer satisfaction including with fares is higher than in any of the metropolitan authorities and higher than in London. However it fails to address the declining use of buses. Between 2001 and 2011 the number of people using the bus to travel to work in Tyne and Wear fell by 13%; the number of adult fare-paying passengers has also declined. Furthermore the survey used to support the claim does not take into account the view of people who no longer use the bus because there simply is not one to catch any more.Go North East claims that the quality contract scheme aims to take funding out of the bus system. That is simply untrue. The quality contract scheme will avoid cuts to secured bus services and to support for discretionary concessionary fares. The voluntary agreement preferred by the bus companies by contrast will lead to significant cuts in secured services and discretionary concessions even if local public support remains at the same level.Go North East claims that the voluntary agreement can start two years earlier than the quality contract scheme can. Many aspects of the voluntary agreement however are unacceptable or incomplete as drafted. In addition the main potential delay to introducing the quality contract scheme would be legal challenge by the bus operators. I hope that they decide to do the right thing: to prioritise customers and recognise the democratic decision of the combined authority.There is an inherent conflict between the desire for the voluntary agreement to be certain legally binding and enforceable and the need for flexibility to avoid the arrangement breaking competition law. Therefore the voluntary agreement relies on trusting each of the operators to abide by the spirit and the letter of the agreement. Even under the voluntary system however bus operators may make changes to services without approval of the partnership board. That does nothing to create stability in our local bus network. Services will continue to be assessed on their commercial returns rather than on their usefulness to local communities.Whatever operators might say the voluntary agreement fails to deliver the Oyster-style ticketing system that is a major advantage of the quality contract scheme. It is clear from the persistent scaremongering threats of legal action and negative campaigning that the bus operators are primarily concerned with protecting profit rather than improving the service for passengers.In a time of difficult decisions about spending it is crucial that we get the best value for money. According to the House of Commons Library the taxpayer subsidised bus services by approximately &#163;2.3 billion in 2011-12. Those subsidies amounted to about 45% of all bus operator revenues. As we are all paying for bus services it is time to ensure that the money that we invest goes back into our communities. Nexus estimates that the quality contract would provide &#163;272 million in economic benefits to the region over a decade by reducing fares providing better services and ensuring more bus passengers.Similarly the northern region TUC concluded that there was a strong business case for the quality contract. It will harness any revenue surplus for the benefit of passengers and communities rather than for bus company shareholders. The proposal would provide a sustainable funding future for buses in our region to a greater extent than all other options.Next Tuesday the North East combined authority will decide whether to introduce a quality contract scheme. The process has been too long and drawn out. I am glad that we would legislate to give local authorities more powers to create better bus networks and to make it easier to implement quality contracts. At the core of the debate is local decisions to deliver a service that works supporting businesses growth and job creation. Local people must have the bus services that they deserve. Even the bus operators acknowledge that the status quo is no longer sustainable. This is our opportunity to lead the way but it is an opportunity that will not come again."},
    {"label":"Julie Elliott","value":"I have two brief points to make because I know we are short of time. I want to speak in support of our amendments. The proposals in the clause are over-bureaucratic and quite frankly over-intrusive into the workings of trade unions.The money raised in political funds is the most regulated money in politics anywhere in the world. It is transparent. If anyone looks at trade unions&#8217; returns they will see where the money has come from and where it is spent. To get to the level of declaring exactly what under &#163;2000 is spent on is absolutely ridiculous. Trade unions make other declarations and people make declarations about where trade union money is spent and that links into the political funds. It is not just the political funds that have to make declarations; the Electoral Commission also gets spending declarations from trade unions.A candidate who gets support from a trade union over a certain amount of money has to declare that to the commission. Election returns to returning officers throughout the country will also clearly state when trade unions have spent money on specific campaigns. What the clause asks for is already in the public domain so I think it is nothing but politically motivated. I will try to be brief. Amendment 39 addresses electronic communications in regard to political funds. Electronic communication is essential in order to hit the Bill&#8217;s deadlines. As I have said before there are almost 6 million trade union members in this country and to communicate effectively with that number of people and to get them to participate in a ballot purely through the post is unrealistic.The Bill says &#8220;either personally&#8221; and several other things. I am not sure whether the Government understand the way in which trade union branches are organised. Small workplace branches at the end of the street or in a place of work are few and far between. I have been a member of various branches in my several decades as a member of three different trade unions. At certain times I have been a member of a workplace branch a branch particular to Sunderland as I am at the moment and for many years of my career a national branch based in London. Are the Government suggesting that travelling to the other end of the country is a reasonable thing to expect someone to do?In evidence last week the Government showed a misunderstanding of who trade unions represent. Quite a number of trade union members are retired because people do not stop being a trade union member when they retire. By virtue of being a retired member of society such people are on a very limited income. In fact many members that trade unions represent are on very small incomes. Do we really expect those people to be left seriously out of pocket when fulfilling their legitimate right to take part in a ballot to decide whether they want a political fund?Moving on electronic communication is absolutely common working practice in 2015. In every other arena this Government want people to communicate electronically. I sat in a Committee Room for many weeks during the proceedings of the Welfare Reform Bill of 2012 in which the then Government introduced online applications for universal credit and discussed them for many other benefits. The Government therefore think electronically is a reasonable way to communicate sensitive personal information the secure transmission of which leads to people getting the money that they need to live on but they do not deem electronic communication acceptable for the communication of whether someone wants to contribute to a political fund. A debate was held just yesterday about registering to vote which involves incredibly sensitive information such as national insurance numbers and dates of birth but the Government view the electronic transmission of such information as acceptable.We have also talked about the acceptance of online banking in this country. The hon. Member for Henley did not take my intervention but regarding the 48% increase in banking fraud I wonder what figure that is a percentage of. I think the hon. Gentleman was a tax adviser in his former life and most tax returns&#8212;what more sensitive information is there than a tax return?&#8212;are done online. It is unbelievable to say that electronic communication is not widely accepted is insecure and does not transmit information that is far more sensitive than a trade union member&#8217;s indication of whether they want their union to have a political fund.Moving on to e-balloting ballots and getting them right are absolutely key. As has been said previously in Committee the balloting process is crucial. Everyone wants the result as quickly as possible and an accurate result is essential for all sides to feel that procedures have been adhered to properly. In the evidence sessions Opposition Members explored the fact that internal political ballots take place all the time including for the Conservative mayoral candidacy in London. I also have much experience in secure workplace balloting which is commonplace for recognition voting under right to recognition legislation. It is up to trade unions their members and employers to decide in which format they want a ballot to take place which varies enormously depending on whether the workplace is nine-to-five with people sitting at computers all day or a shift-pattern industrial workplace. The range of balloting arrangements is enormous but certification officers are always happy with such arrangements and there are few challenges.Secure workplace balloting is less disruptive and is over much more quickly than the methods proposed in the Bill. Let us not forget that trade union members could be taking part in a ballot that could affect their income. Many trade union members are low-paid workers so the decision to lose a day&#8217;s pay is a significant decision that they would not take lightly. From the employer&#8217;s side the quicker that it gets a result and thus a conclusion to what will have been by that point protracted negotiations will be to the benefit of all. I really cannot see why the Government are so opposed to e-balloting or secure workplace balloting.Surely the aim of any part of the Bill is to get the maximum participation possible. That is what it should encourage in line with the compliance measures for thresholds earlier in the Bill. On the one hand the Bill seems to say &#8220;We absolutely want almost everybody to &#160;take part in the ballot&#8221; but on the other hand it says &#8220;We want to do everything to discourage and dissuade people from taking part by putting every possible obstacle in place.&#8221; This morning the Minister acknowledged indirectly that electronic communication in other parts of the Bill is acceptable. I struggle to understand the Government&#8217;s opposition to our amendment and new clauses. Good afternoon Sir Edward. As ever it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship and to see the speed at which you got here today to be on time.I wish to speak in support of amendments 34 and 35 which were tabled in my name and those of my hon. and right hon. Friends. This Government and the previous Government which the Conservative party was part of have made great play of their desire to get rid of red tape but the Bill is full of red tape and this clause makes it extremely difficult for trade union members to contribute to political funds.In all the evidence we heard last week on political funds no one said that they were a problem or that there were any problems associated with them. Further than that the thrust of the Bill and these clauses is all about the links to funding the Labour party. That is important from my point of view but we must not forget that political funds are used for other campaigning measures. Two of the most prominent campaigns that I was involved in during my time working for a trade union were the campaign to stop needle injuries for clothing and textile workers and the campaign to promote recognition of the subtle signs of domestic violence taking place and causing people to lose days at work. Political funds are used for a much broader range of things than just helping to fund the Labour party although obviously that is an area that I am very concerned about.The clause is politically motivated. To limit the ability of a political party to raise funds legitimately through its affiliated trade unions is nothing less than scandalous. It goes against 100 years of common practice where any changes in this area have historically been agreed between parties through cross-party talks. If this is what the Government want to do then instead of just taking a sledgehammer to what has been common &#160;practice all these years they should call for cross-party talks and have a serious discussion about some of the issues in these clauses.As it stands the opt-in works. Because it works no one is calling for change&#8212;except the Government. There is no problem with the opt-in. When I administered part of a political fund in my previous life before entering Parliament no one raised a problem with it. If people wanted to opt out after they had opted in that simply was not a problem. They contacted us and we opted them out. I have to say that very few people choose to opt out and that is bearing in mind that members of trade unions are not just Labour party supporters&#8212;they vote Labour Liberal Democrat and SNP and some even vote Conservative.That said let us look at the detail of the clause and the amendments. I firmly believe that the Government&#8217;s proposals are not workable; the thrust of the amendments is to make them workable. Our amendments are clear and straightforward and would extend the time limits to a more realistic timeframe. Almost 6 million people are members of trade unions in this country. It is absolutely ludicrous to think that unions could physically sign up by paper nearly 6 million people in three months. I do not know what resources the Government think trade unions have but that is not a workable option. It is impossible. By default the Government would not be giving the opportunity for trade union members to sign up because it would be impossible for trade unions to make their full membership aware within the timescale set out in the Bill.There are obviously issues around using electronic means to sign people up&#8212;we will come on to that in our consideration of later amendments when I will go into more detail&#8212;but it would have a significant impact on the Bill if we were allowed to use e-means to sign people up. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth outlined the Bill goes way beyond the Companies Act 2006. That Act covers political donations from companies which the Conservative party gets most of its funding from. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friends would bring the Bill into line with existing legislation in particular in relation to the 10-year ballot to decide if a trade union holds a political fund or not. Let us remember that trade unions do not have to hold political funds although I think they all do.The existing legislation which has been there for many years is very workable. It is a well trodden path and there are no problems with it. The way to make the opt-in measures practicable is to have sensible time limits and link them to existing legislation. Even the Minister has said with regard to the code of conduct that these things work well. Let us simplify the Bill and bring it together with the existing legislation. The bureaucratic nature of the Bill at the moment means that it simply will not work in practice. Removing the time limits would make it a workable piece of legislation although I would still disagree with it.Legislation covering the operation of political funds should be fair and reasonable to be in line with all international agreements covering the rights of trade unions freedom of association and a union&#8217;s ability to engage in political debates. This is key: we must allow unions the freedom to engage in political debates. As it stands the Bill will not do that so I urge the Government &#160;to support our amendments. If they want their Bill to be workable bringing in sensible time limits is the only sensible way forward. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again Sir Alan. I want to speak in support of the amendments in the names of my right hon. and hon. Friends concerning the differences between &#8220;essential&#8221; and &#8220;important&#8221; public services. I totally agree with the comments from my hon. Friend who has outlined the problems very clearly.As written these clauses unworkable in practice. Everything I have said so far in this Committee has been about the practicalities of the Bill and that is really where I want to start today but before doing that I want to talk about the definition of essential public services. It is a well established well trodden path: everybody understands what it is. The Conservative manifesto and Her Majesty&#8217;s Gracious Speech both talked about essential public services. During our consideration of the previous group of amendments the Minister said &#8220;Of course we respect the mandate of the commitments made in manifestos.&#8221; If that is what he believes this flies in the face of it and is an absolute contradiction so I would like to hear his comments on that matter.The TUC is a representative body of 52 trade unions most of which are not affiliated to a political party representing almost 6 million people&#8212;the TUC expresses the views of a substantial body of people. On pages 2 and 3 of its written evidence the TUC mentions that the Employment Lawyers Association&#8220;has warned the government against introducing thresholds to services not covered by the ILO definition of &#8216;essential services&#8217;.&#8221;The ELA clearly recognises that there will be problems with the definition. Page 3 of the evidence states:&#8220;The TUC is concerned that the Bill does not define &#8216;important public services&#8217;. Instead the government plans to specify which workers will be covered by 40 per cent threshold in regulations. MPs will therefore have limited opportunity to scrutinise and amend new legislation which restricts the democratic rights of millions of UK workers.&#8221;In oral evidence Dave Prentis the general secretary of the largest public sector union Unison talked about life and limb cover; but in their oral evidence some of the people who support the Bill did not seem to understand either what life and limb cover is or that it even exists. Dave Prentis&#8217;s evidence is highly pertinent. Once again I feel that the Government are heading blindly into legal action. Recklessly changing the definition will cause major problems and ultimately could restrict by the back door the right of workers in the private sector to take what I regard as legitimate strike or industrial action.The public sector has changed out of all recognition over the past 20 years. It now has substantial organisations whether in local government the national health service or other areas. There is a melange of different constructs whether they are outsourced by contracts let by bidding that contain clauses with which some of this legislation might clash or whether they are in arm&#8217;s length management organisations. Will people in cleaning services for example be deemed as essential or important or will they be deemed as not important? Different cleaning services in a hospital might be treated differently. Someone who cleans a reception area might be treated differently from someone who cleans operating theatres. All of those things will come into the mix at every stage of every different industrial dispute. The cost implications have not been thought through.It would be much safer and would practically avoid the risk of litigation if we stuck to the term &#8220;essential public services.&#8221; The Conservative Government have a mandate for that from their manifesto commitment and from Her Majesty&#8217;s Gracious Speech. The term is well defined unlike the alternative in the Bill which will be incredibly difficult for MPs to scrutinise and will restrict the right of many people to take industrial action. Almost inevitably the result will be litigation which will cost taxpayers money. Every time the Government go to court when they have not thought proposals through&#8212;we saw many instances in the previous Parliament particularly in the energy sector where the Government lost cases&#8212;the cost of that litigation returns to the taxpayers who fund Government court cases. I urge the Government to consider these proposals carefully. Although we disagree with the Bill&#8217;s substance these amendments would at least make the clause workable. Also I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s comments on his party&#8217;s manifesto. Like my colleagues I refer to the declarations I made at the start of proceedings last week. I want to talk in practical terms about my experience of what was referred to in some of the evidence but I will start by saying that I totally support the comments made by my hon. Friends today. The overarching thrust of the Bill is that it will make thresholds almost impossible to meet. The premise of the Bill is based on a total lack of understanding of how the real world of industrial relations works in this country today.In the real world industrial action is always an absolute last resort. Last week in the evidence session some of the leaders of the largest trade unions stated that industrial action is not what trade unions are about and not what &#160;they aim for. At the end of the day their members lose money by taking industrial action. They often represent some of the lowest-paid people in society and that is always at the forefront for any trade union leader or official when negotiating.No one takes industrial action lightly. Trade union officials are trained today in order to avert industrial action at all costs. However it is a legal right and is there as a last resort. That needs to be borne in mind in everything we are discussing today. The thresholds proposed in the Bill of 50% and 40% are extreme in their nature. Modern ways of working were outlined very articulately last week by the general secretary of Unison Mr Dave Prentis when he talked about partnership working. The big trade unions today work very closely with the employers of their members whether in the public or private sector. Obviously one of the thresholds applies to all the second applies to the public sector of a yet undefined group of people.Partnership working is about building up relationships and getting to know people and to understand the way they work and what the real issues and nubs of the problems are. Some of the later measures in the Bill will have an impact on that working. Removing some of the facility time from people will not lead to better relationships or better partnership working. The opposite will happen and there will be a lack of trust and understanding of people and where they come from.Some of the later proposals on check-off are probably even more significant. A ballot is the most intensive thing that any trade union and any employer prepares for which is why the vast majority of employers in this country are not comfortable with the Bill. Drawing up the list of eligible people in the bargaining group is the most difficult thing that anyone on either side has to do. Check-off facilitates and helps with that process because it means that the employer knows exactly where a person works within the organisation but that is not known if someone pays by direct debit. There is also potentially a data protection issue because if someone pays their trade union membership by direct debit that information is confidential and known only by the union member and the trade union not the employer. Therefore in an industrial action ballot the crucial checks and balances for getting the lists correct will not be there. Everyone wants the lists to be correct because if they are not the matter will end up in court. That might well be the motivation behind some of it. As I said in my opening remarks the measure makes it almost impossible for certain types of dispute to take place.If the trade union side has to spend so much extra time not only on getting the lists correct but on making the turnout so high that is time the officials are not spending on talking to the employer and trying to avert strike action which has to be the motive of everyone involved in an industrial dispute. The only way to resolve a dispute whether an industrial dispute or any other disagreement in life is by talking to people. If there is no time to sit down and talk constructively the problem escalates. That is common sense.So much time will be spent on the accuracy of the lists with all the problems that the later clauses of the Bill throw up and then on getting the enormous turnout. The 50% threshold is a difficult one in itself but adding on the 40% threshold is incredible if not completely unrealistic except in a specific workplace with everyone working for one employer as the rail disputes in recent history have shown. In the broader public sector there is genuine doubt as to whether the 40% threshold is achievable. The evidence from Stephen Cavalier from Thompsons Solicitors is that it will probably lead to more industrial action. Professor Ewing says in paragraph 10 of his written evidence:&#8220;The ILO Committee of Experts pointed out that &#8216;account should only be taken of the votes cast&#8217; while any &#8216;required quorum and majority should be fixed at a reasonable level&#8217;.&#8221;I defy anybody to say that some of the measures in the Bill around thresholds are reasonable.Where will the Bill take us if it comes into law as it is written today? My view is that it will make positive industrial relations much more difficult. Because of that it will inevitably lead to more strikes which I do not believe is what any Member on either side of the House wants. It will most likely lead to the Government ending up in court with a massive cost to the taxpayer. Nobody wants us to end up in that situation so I urge the Government to look again at the two thresholds.As ever it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Gray. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck) my constituency neighbour on securing this important debate whichcentres on the performance of the Tyne and Wear Metro service but I will also address the service&#8217;s future to which she alluded.In the past nine months for which figures are available42749 excess minutes were recorded which is more than double the Metro&#8217;s target. Causes include power failures leaves on the line and train malfunctions. The majority of complaints received were due to train service performance. I live near a Metro station so my family and I understand the Metro&#8217;s benefits all too well. The Metro is and has been a great service and I remember when it first started. [Interruption.] We are all showing our age this afternoon.The Metro has not been reliable over the past few years. If I turn up in the morning to catch the Metro to Newcastle to get a train down here&#8212;when I am not getting a Sunderland train&#8212;a delay can make the difference between catching my train and not catching my train. The Metro runs to the airport so it has to be reliable. People have to be at the airport a certain amount of time in advance and people have complained to me that they have missed flights because of problems with the Metro. Part of the issue is that there are not many public transport alternatives. It is not like London where if the buses go off the tube is there; or if the tube goes off there are lots of buses. In the north-east people who live within travelling distance of the Tyne and Wear Metro rely on that service and historically it was very reliable. The benefits of living near the Metro are great but the problem is that it needs to be reliable.People are not just being penalised for losing minutes at work; they can lose their job if they are consistently late for work. Employers are not interested in why people are late for work but in whether they are there on time to do the job they are paid to do and I totally understand that. It is a very serious problem. Of the 502 complaints in April and May this year most were to do with train service performance. It is a real issue across the piece.I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. It is absolutely true that productivity is essential. Economically the north-east is one of the most productive regions in the country. We are still the only region that has a positive balance of trade. We export enormously which is something to be proud of but people have to get to their jobs to be able to create that productivity.It is clear that Nexus will have to procure a new fleet of trains to meet identified customer demand. The number of people travelling on public transport goes up all the time. From an environmental point of view that is important. As has been said the fleet started carrying passengers in 1980. The refurbishment going on at themoment will take it to around 2025 but further refurbishment is not cost-effective. The trains are cranky and noisy and there is a limit to what can be done with old stock. By the middle of the next decade the trains will represent 50-year-old technology with all the problems that go with that including low levels of reliability poor energy efficiency and poor compliance with accessibility legislation. When they were introduced they were trailblazing but they are now old hat. As someone over 50 I understand the problems that getting older creates: you are not quite as good as you were a few years ago. New trains are critical. They will improve reliability and punctuality for the more than 38 million passengers who use the service every year.I want to move on to the disparity in funding between the regions. According to recent research undertaken by the Equality Trust if we combine bus and rail the average amount of money in Government subsidy spent on transport for each household in the north-east is &#163;139 a year. For those in the south-east it is &#163;204. The figures speak for themselves. If the northern powerhouse is to amount to anything more than a vanity project for the Chancellor he needs to put his money where his mouth is and he needs to use the Budget next week to direct extra money into public transport in our region. A new fleet is central to securing a better more punctual and energy-efficient Metro service. Given the costs involved Government financing will be crucial. These things inevitably take time so I urge the Minister to begin talks now to ensure that passengers in Sunderland who rely on the Metro to go to work attend hospital appointments and visit family and friends get the service they need and deserve.It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Howarth. I thank the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake) for securing the debate. That fact that 18 Members from four parties have taken part shows how important and pressing the subject is for many parties. I know the Thirsk and Malton area well and acknowledge its beauty. My train stops there on the way down to London and on the way back although I have another hour to go then.This is the first debate I have participated in from the Front Bench on the subject of shale gas. Before the election my former colleague Tom Greatrex who was the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West looked after this area of policy. His expertise on energy policy was recognised on both sides of the House and I am sure that Parliament will miss his knowledge and good humour.Our position on shale gas was formally set out in debates on the Infrastructure Act 2015. We made it clear that there should be no shale gas extraction without a framework of robust regulation and comprehensive inspection. Regrettably the Government have consistently sidelined our legitimate environmental concerns and those of the public in a headlong dash for gas. Speeches from different parties today supported that view. With 80% of homes in Britain still reliant on gas for heating shale gas may have a role to play in displacing some of the gas that we currently import boosting our energy security; but I want to make it clear that that potential worthwhile benefit must not come at the expense of robust environmental protection or our climate change commitments.During the passage of the Infrastructure Act 2015 we were clear about what changes were needed. The Government initially accepted Labour&#8217;s amendment to overhaul the regulatory regime for shale gas by introducing 13 vital measures before extraction could occur. That was a huge Government U-turn and a great victory for the protection of Britain&#8217;s environment. However in the House of Lords the Government watered down five of those crucial commitments.The Government watered down regulations to prevent fracking under drinking water aquifers ignoring the existing definition of such areas and insisting on the need for a new definition&#8212;thus scope was opened up for the weakening of the measure through leaving some areas out. They weakened regulations to prevent fracking under protected areas such as national parks dropping our proposal to prevent fracking &#8220;within or under&#8221; protected areas. Instead they indicated that they would block fracking only &#8220;within&#8221; them creating the prospectthat protected areas such as areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks could be ringed by operators fracking underneath them. They dropped requirements for operators to notify all residents individually of potential developments and to monitor all fugitive emissions&#8212;not just methane. Finally they weakened regulations requiring an environmental impact assessment at all sites.We tabled an amendment to reverse those changes but were denied a vote. There should be no shale gas developments in the UK unless those protections are re-introduced. It is right that individual applications should be decided at local level as has been outlined this week. It is not the place of central Government to become involved and to trump local democracy. That is the Eric Pickles way of doing business. It is not mine nor that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). However the decisions made in Lancashire in the past few days and people&#8217;s concerns reflect the fact that the Government have repeatedly ignored genuine and legitimate public concern in a dash for shale gas at all costs.Does the Minister accept that the continued public concern over shale gas extraction might be caused at least in part by the Government&#8217;s refusal to address their legitimate concerns? Does she agree with me that the best approach would be to accept as they have once before the amendment that Labour tabled to the Infrastructure Act 2015 which would ensure there was a robust regulatory framework? Without that people will not have the confidence they need and to which they are entitled. I look forward to the Minster&#8217;s reply to those concerns and to the crucial questions of many colleagues. There is public concern across the country as yesterday&#8217;s events in Lancashire showed. I hope she will address those things directly so that the public can be fully informed of the issues in this important debate about how we can safely and most cost-effectively meet our energy needs and our climate change commitments.I am afraid this feels like &#8220;Here we go again.&#8221; Less than two months ago my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) spoke from the shadow Front Bench against a Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) which would remove all subsidies for offshore wind. Today we find ourselves in a similar debate on a Bill to destroy the UK&#8217;s burgeoning onshore wind industry.I think I speak for many Members when I say how much I enjoyed the &#8220;Inside the Commons&#8221; documentary. I was pleased that it showed people how Parliament works and what MPs do and that we are all things considered still normal people doing a job to the best of our abilities. There was general amusement at the sight of Members from both sides of the House queuing in shifts to secure private Members&#8217; Bills. Two of those people were of course the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) who has just spoken and the hon. Member for Christchurch. I only wish their time in the queue and our time here discussing the Bill today could have been better spent.Onshore wind is one of the cheapest large-scale renewable energy technologies. With the right support it could be subsidy-free by the end of the next Parliament. This Bill in the unlikely event that it should ever become law would kill the UK&#8217;s onshore wind industry and in doing so destroy thousands of jobs and millions of pounds of investment and lead to higher energy bills.No I am going to carry on.If the hon. Gentleman had his way and we shut off support mechanisms such as the renewables obligation and contracts for difference the UK would simply be more reliant on more expensive technologies to meet our crucial carbon emissions commitments. Those of us on this side of the House are committed to decarbonising at the lowest possible cost to the consumer. That is why we are committed to setting a 2030 power sector decarbonisation target which will give investors the long-term certainty they need to invest.Let me point out a few important facts. Last year onshore wind generated over 5% of UK electricity generation and the independent Committee on Climate Change estimates that onshore wind can provide over 15% of our power needs by 2030. Onshore wind generated over 16 TWh of electricity in 2014&#8212;enough to power almost 4 million homes. There is currently more than 8 GW of onshore wind capacity with a further 1.2 GW under construction and more than 5 GW with consent. Last week saw the results of the first allocation rounds for CfDs. Labour supported the introduction of CfDs as we did during the passage through Parliament of the Energy Bill. Cost reductions&#8212;which mean less subsidy which translates into lower consumer bills&#8212;are real and are happening now. New onshore wind projects from 2016 to 2018 will produce power at &#163;79.23 to &#163;82.50 per megawatt-hour&#8212;less than other renewable energy technologies and less than new nuclear. The industry is committed to being the cheapest form of new large-scale electricity generation by 2020&#8212;cheaper even than new gas plants.This is a job-creating sector: the onshore wind sector employs directly and indirectly19000 people in this country. Onshore wind is popular. The Department of Energy and Climate Change&#8217;s public attitudes tracking survey has found consistent public support for onshore wind. The latest figures show that 68% of the public support onshore wind with opposition at only 12%. That is not just theoretical support for the concept of onshore wind. It is important to note that people support onshore wind developments in their communities. A2014 ComRes poll found that 62% of people would be happy for an onshore wind farm to be constructed in their area.It is of course crucial for local communities to be consulted and to be fully engaged in any renewable energy development. The Government and in particular the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government preach localism. However the Secretary of State has taken Whitehall intervention in the planning system to unprecedented heights.If I had a pound for every time I heard a Conservative Member criticise clean energy technologies for reasons that bear no relationship to cost genuine public concern or engineering feasibility I could personally fund the levy control framework for several years. The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provided overwhelming and compelling scientific evidence that climate change is real that it is caused by human activity and that it will have devastating consequences if urgent action is not taken to cut our carbon emissions and invest in mitigation.I would have welcomed the time to engage in a serious debate this morning about onshore wind and about how we can increase investment and drive down costs. However no debate on a Bill that would implement an effective ban on onshore wind can be a serious one. Let me repeat a question that I have asked Conservative Members before in the House. They do not like onshore wind they do not like offshore wind and they do not like solar. Are there any clean energy technologies that they actually support?All modern economies face the same energy &#8220;trilemma&#8221;: how can we generate the energy that we need which is clean affordable and secure? Onshore wind delivers on all three counts. It is clean it is on course to be subsidy-free and it is based in the United Kingdom boosting local economies and creating jobs.Perhaps the hon. Member for Wellingborough&#8217;s queuing was not a waste of time after all. It has given me an opportunity to expose the Conservative party&#8217;s growing hostility to onshore wind and to set out how the next Labour Government will work with clean energy developers to ensure that we have the affordable secure and clean energy that our economy needs in order to succeed.It is as ever a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Gray. Usually the debate on these issues is longer than this has been but I suspect the timing has made a difference.I commend the work of the Energy and Climate Change Committee and agree with many of the comments made by its Chair the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo). The report is an important one given how disappointing the green deal has been.The Committee hit the nail on the head in its first recommendation stating that 18 months in&#8220;the Green Deal has so far been a failure.&#8221;Unsurprisingly in their response to the report the Government disagree with that assessment but I think it is fair to say that success of the green deal has been underwhelming.The green deal was heralded by the Government as the biggest home improvement scheme since the second world war but frankly DECC&#8217;s latest figures show unacceptable results with only 4721 completed green deals. The green deal is simply not a good deal. The interest rate is not competitive or attractive and often the deal does not fund the measures that people want and need. The green deal is not the tool we need to correct large-scale market failure. Consumers and installers have been let down and that is without even mentioning the debacle of the green deal home improvement fund.We in the Labour party believe that we have solutions to the problems of the green deal which I will take about briefly towards the end of my remarks but I first want to highlight some of the Select Committee&#8217;s other recommendations to which the Government should pay real attention. The report pulls no punches. Recommendation 1 described the green deal as a failure and urged the Government to deal with the barriers that prevent even adequate take-up. The Committee&#8217;s opinions are shared by the shadow Ministers. The most disappointing element of the Government response was the complete unwillingness to accept what the Committee and many others are saying.Recommendation 5 is of great significance and I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. The green deal and the energy companies obligation should dovetail and be complementary but we have seen the complete opposite and I do not think that the Government know how to rectify that. Again I was disappointed by the Government response which was to claim that the green deal home improvement fund was part of the solution to the problem. I hope that the Minister can clarify how that judgment was reached given the farce that followed the sudden closure of the first round in July and the numerous complaints that have followed. The fund is simply not a long-term solution but is instead the Government throwing money at the problem.The attractiveness of the green deal is also criticised in the report with a key point made in recommendation 7:&#8220;Unless the package is made more attractive to a wider group of consumers Green Deal finance is likely to remain unappealing to many.&#8221;Again rather disappointingly the Government response points to the green deal home improvement fund as an answer. I fail to see how a short-term measure will provide a solution. I would prefer some long-term thinking by the Government which has been sorely lacking so far. The green deal home improvement fund is not and never will be a long-term sustainable policy.Finally of all the excellent recommendations in the report I will touch on recommendation 11: better targeting of energy efficiency measures on those who need help the most primarily the fuel-poor. I share the Committee&#8217;s view that the Government should be doing more and I was heartened to see tacit agreement in the Government response. However their actions towards the fuel-poor do not match up. The affordable warmth element which is explicitly aimed at those most in need was scandalously cut by the Government in 2013 for political reasons despite its having done a lot of good work. It cannot be stressed enough to the Minister that the best way to get household bills down and crucially keep them down is to prioritise energy efficiency and insulate people&#8217;s homes. The Government sought to do the opposite which is quite frankly unforgiveable.I am aware that it is all too easy to criticise the green deal and the Government have only themselves to blame for that but we in the shadow energy team have put our money where our mouth is and in November last year launched our energy efficiency green paper setting out proposals that we believe would solve the issues that the green deal and energy efficiency in general have been struggling with on this Government&#8217;s watch. Our policy has five key points relevant to the discussion today.First we would provide half a million personalised home energy reports a year which would detail how households could save money on their energy bills through insulation and energy efficiency. I think many would agree that levels of public knowledge about energy efficiency and the products available such as heating controls are very low but we can easily give the public that information and it will help.Secondly we would administer free energy efficiency improvements for 200000 households in or at risk of fuel poverty every year with an ambition to upgrade all such homes and end the scandal of cold homes within 15 years. This chimes with the report&#8217;s recommendation that more should be done to target those most in need. It should save the average household around &#163;270 a year and provide a much needed boost given the failings of the ECO especially following the disastrous changes to it in the 2013 autumn statement.Thirdly for those able to pay we would replace the flop that is the green deal with a much less bureaucratic system. Most important during the next Parliament we would offer up to 1 million interest-free loans to cover the costs of energy efficiency improvements&#8212;something that as the report highlights DECC is unwilling even to consider. For the private rented sector which was singled out in the report there would be a new target to upgrade properties to a minimum of EPC band C by 2027 which is far more ambitious than anything the Government have committed to.We have also promised that energy efficiency will be designated as a national infrastructure priority under Labour&#8217;s proposed national infrastructure commission giving energy efficiency the importance it has lacked under this Government. Finally we would put in place a long-term streamlined strategy to support investment in energy efficiency in the non-domestic sector.The Committee&#8217;s report delivers some stinging criticism of the green deal&#8212;all of it warranted. I sincerely hope the Minister will take on board many of the points raised today. The report&#8217;s conclusions accurately sum up where DECC has failed on both the green deal and energy efficiency as a whole. It is clear to me that the only hope for a pay-as-you-save model and for energy efficiency as a whole is a Labour Government after the election.It is as ever a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mrs Riordan. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) on securing the debate and I applaud the graphic detailed way in which she outlined the problem faced by all Members of Parliament in the north-east. Sadly the cases she outlined are not unusual. They are common&#8212;even the case where the gentleman died. There has been more than one such example in recent times in the north-east and that is completely unacceptable.I will start by talking about the staff at Jobcentre Plus and the DWP in general. They work hard and are put under enormous pressure. Staffing levels have diminished dramatically since 2010. We hear anecdotally about the pressures of informal targets on sanctions&#8212;we all know they are in place&#8212;from people who are too frightened to say something so they tell us off the record. I sympathise enormously with them about the job they are being asked to do every day.The other thing I want to discuss before I go on to the example I will talk about is the north-east&#8217;s economy. I have lived in the north-east my entire life. I live two miles from where I was born which is very common in the north-east. We are a close-knit supportive community and that is replicated throughout the north-east not just the part I am from. We have had high unemployment throughout my lifetime&#8212;obviously there have been peaks and troughs but it has been consistent. Although more jobs are available at the minute their quality has to be questioned: a lot involve zero-hours or temporary contracts so they give no stability.We have a lot of people who through no fault of their own rely on benefits. We are also a low-wage economy. Furthermore most people&#8217;s families do not have massive wealth so if people fall on hard times their families do not have the wealth to support them informally. If somebody&#8217;s benefits are sanctioned they really do have no money. They cannot go to their families to ask for a little help because their families simply do not have the money. It is not that they do not want to help&#8212;they simply do not have the finances to.The other thing to say about the background of people in the north-east is that we are a hard-working area. Life is pretty tough for many people but peoplehave an ethos of working hard paying their way and doing a fair day&#8217;s work for a fair day&#8217;s pay. That is the mindset of people in the north-east and I take great offence when I read or hear about people criticising the area and talking as if people there were just scroungers because that simply is not the case. I have no truck with people who really try to fiddle the system and I would be the first to remove their benefits and sanction them but they are not the norm and they are not the people we are talking about.People who need to claim benefits should be treated with dignity and respect not only by those they deal with at the DWP and Jobcentre Plus but by the rest of society. They should not be made to feel that they are worth any less than the person next to them because for whatever reason they have to live on benefits. However the treatment people receive often falls short; in some cases it is absolutely appalling and unacceptable.I want to give an example of a case study I have had. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central I get a staggering number of cases every week. A few months ago I had a constituent who was unable to attend an appointment at Jobcentre Plus because he had suffered an asthma attack and was in A and E. He telephoned his adviser to tell them although to be fair it would have been perfectly reasonable if he had not managed to do that. However he did and he spoke to the receptionist about the Jobcentre Plus appointment that had been scheduled for that day which he would clearly be unable to get to. He explained his reasons and on returning from hospital he sent a letter.A few weeks later he received a letter saying that he had failed to comply with the scheme&#8217;s requirements and that his jobseeker&#8217;s allowance would be sanctioned for one month. Extraordinarily the letter went on to say that an asthma attack was not a sufficiently good reason for missing an appointment. I am an asthmatic myself and I know how crucial it is for people to get to hospital pretty darn quick if they have an attack that is out of control. The difference between not getting treated correctly in a timely fashion and surviving is paper-thin and we read every year about the tragic cases of people who have not got to hospital quickly enough. However if people get to hospital in time they can be treated and brought back to health quite easily. The time element is crucial which is why I said that although my constituent took the time to ring it would have been acceptable if he had not.Miraculously when my constituent came to me and I got involved the decision was overturned. The most annoying thing is not that it was overturned&#8212;that was absolutely the right thing to do&#8212;but that it was made in the first place and that my constituent ever had to come to me. That is the problem and that is what needs sorting out.If people are ill or have other genuine reasons for not being able to get somewhere at a certain time they need to be treated fairly. They need to be treated like anybody else in any other system and to be believed. In this case my constituent had discharge letters from hospital; there was no question but that he had been at hospital but that was not seen as a reason not to attend an appointment. That is just one case but it graphically explains the problem.I do not want to go over other cases because we all have them. The people we are talking about are vulnerable. Many have not always been on benefits and the unemployment that has arisen in the last few years is new to them. They are not part of a culture of benefit claiming. Treating them in this absolutely inhumane way is wrong and unacceptable&#8212;there is no other way of saying it&#8212;and it reflects badly on the DWP the Government and in broader terms us as a society. We should be proud of the fact that we have a safety net for people who fall on hard times.As ever it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Gray. I wish you and all colleagues a happy new year. I congratulate the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir) and the Backbench Business Committeeon bringing forward this important debate.It will come as no surprise to those taking part in the debate&#8212;we talk about such things a lot and I too was on the Committee that considered the Energy Act 2013 and have gone over the arguments at length many times; but I am pleased to have the opportunity at this early stage in the new year to reaffirm Labour&#8217;s commitment to cutting our carbon emissions by encouraging investment in clean energy through the system of contracts for difference. I want to make a few comments on some of the speeches. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) said there is a broad consensus&#8212;barring the views of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) who has a slightly different view from ours. I like some other right hon. and hon. Members am committed both to renewables and to nuclear which will both have an important part to play in the energy mix. We need both of them to reach our carbon emissions targets and negate the problems arising from climate change.Many of the issues that have been raised are of concern to us&#8212;particularly the question of investment and security and knowing the way forward. That has been raised with me in my capacity as an MP representing an area on the north-east coast where many of the issues that have been discussed today are relevant andwhere there is potential to benefit from development of the industry. Investors tell me that they want certainty. They want to know where we are going and that there is a long-term plan. The decision cannot be one for four or five years. There is broad consensus and much of what I want to say concerns that but there are some issues.Scotland as we know plays an important role in the UK&#8217;s clean energy generation. It is blessed with significant clean energy resources including onshore and offshore wind and wave and tidal energy have significant potential. Scotland&#8217;s leadership in clean energy is borne out in the funding that it receives from central Government. This year having travelled many times north of the border in the referendum campaign&#8212;it is not that far from where I live&#8212;I have seen as I have driven up towards Glasgow hundreds and hundreds of onshore wind turbines which I think are quite beautiful and add to the scenery on the drive. They are clearly a significant part of the economy north of the border.Scotland currently benefits from a system in which resources from across the UK are pooled. Scotland hosts 8.3% of the UK population and around 9% of the energy bill consumer base from which we fund clean energy projects via the levy control framework. In 2012-13 Scotland received nearly a third of all renewable obligation certificates supporting renewable energy. Furthermore Scotland will receive a significant proportion of the support given through feed-in tariffs which in 2014-15 is projected to reach &#163;817 million.As has been said the UK is a world leader in offshore wind with as much installed capacity as the rest of the world combined. I see that as a positive for us not a negative as the hon. Member for Christchurch sees it. It is therefore critical that we get the right structures and funding in place so that the cost of offshore wind continues to fall. To ensure that that happens and that the contract for difference allocation works for offshore wind we need to boost the investment that drives cost reductions. We have seen the massive cost reductions that investment can bring in both solar and onshore wind.Although Labour&#8212;and most parties as the hon. Member for Angus said in his contribution&#8212;supported the Energy Bill as it progressed through Parliament there were significant areas in which we were convinced that it needed to go further. I do not intend to pr&#233;cis our &#8220;Powering Britain&#8221; Green Paper as I am quite confident that most people here have read it cover to cover. However what was missing from the Energy Bill in addition to reform of the wholesale or retail markets through which energy is traded were policies to encourage further investment in clean energy. Labour is committed to setting a 2030 power sector decarbonisation target which is supported by organisations as varied as the Committee on Climate Change energy developers such as Siemens and Dong Energy and companies such as Asda Sky and PepsiCo as a crucial tool to provide certainty and clarity to drive investment.Labour will establish an energy security board. My right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn and my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) mentioned long-term security. An energy security board will plan for and deliver on our energy needs for the future. We will give the green investment bank powers to borrow and leverage new investment. We are focusedon looking beyond parliamentary terms and changes in Government to give stability for investors in the energy market.I take that guidance from the Chair but I will say that we won the referendum.Given this Government&#8217;s refusal to set a 2030 power sector decarbonisation target or allow the green investment bank to borrow it is unsurprising that investment in renewable energy has fallen. Furthermore according to the Environmental Audit Committee investment in clean energy is running at half the level necessary if we are to meet our carbon emission reductions. It is also worth pointing out that the majority of renewable energy projects that have come online since May 2010 started under the last Labour Government.The offshore wind industry certainly welcomed the increase in the budget for less established technologies from &#163;155 million to &#163;235 million although it was somewhat tempered by the downward revision in the reference price. Can the Minister confirm that the downward revision will have a significant impact on how much capacity is feasible for the same amount of budget? Currently approximately 5 GW of offshore wind is in operation or construction and about another 3.2 GW has been given final investment decision contracts. Do the Government have a fixed ambition for offshore wind either by 2020 or another date and can it be assumed that that ambition has been reflected in the allocation funding pot? Does the Minister share the view of industry experts who have projected that the &#163;235 million equates to approximately 800 MW and is he satisfied with the Government&#8217;s ambition for offshore wind in this allocation round? Those questions reflect some of the concerns expressed by hon. Members in this debate.This Government&#8217;s mixed messages and active hostility to onshore wind and solar PV the cheapest large-scale clean energy technologies have acted as significant blows to investment in all clean energy technologies. In the last few months the UK slipped to seventh place on Ernst and Young&#8217;s attractiveness index for investment in renewable energy and Ernst and Young labelled the Government&#8217;s&#8220;policy tinkering and conflicting signals&#8221;as&#8220;too much for investors&#8230;to handle&#8221;.Does the Minister accept that the Government&#8217;s mixed messages have damaged investment?Although offshore wind remains an area in which the UK proudly leads the world employing thousands of people and generating the clean energy that we need tomeet our carbon emissions commitments it is clear that costs will have to continue to fall and allocation rounds should be designed to reflect that priority."},
    {"label":"Sharon Hodgson","value":"Thank you very much Mr Bone for chairing this debate this afternoon. I also thank the hon. Memberfor Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss) for securing this important debate and other Members for their excellent contributions.We need to keep our focus on this issue and I am very pleased that all the Members who have spoken so far share my passion for extolling the virtues of breastfeeding. I am also pleased to note that the Minister present today is the Under-Secretary of State for Life Sciences who I respect hugely. Although at first I thought it was rather strange that breastfeeding came under his brief I am now sure that it is simply the case that the issue is so important to the Government and crosses so many departmental boundaries that they settled on him and it was not just a case of Ministers perhaps playing &#8220;pass the parcel&#8221; with this important debate. As I say I am very pleased to see that he is here to respond to it.I will start my remarks by putting my cards firmly on the table&#8212;for me wherever possible breast is best. I breastfed both my children as all the Members who have spoken so far breastfed their children and I am evangelical about the merits of breastfeeding.As other Members have said and shared breastfeeding sometimes hurts at first&#8212;although not for everyone&#8212;and that is why the right support is vital to help women and encourage them to carry on breastfeeding. Having someone physically there really makes the difference especially when a woman has a baby like my son who did not like to open his mouth very wide when latching on. If he could get away with it he would just suck on the nipple until it was red raw and obviously he then got no milk. If nobody had told me that that is not how it is supposed to happen I would have given up immediately. Support is vital. As with my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) my second child&#8212;my daughter&#8212;could not tolerate cows&#8217; milk. Fortunately I was able to carry on feeding her to about 16 months but feeding a toddler in public draws lots of frowns and eventually I succumbed. We went on to soya milk and even now she does not really like milk.We have a fabulous support network in the north-east called Bosom Buddies which helps supports and encourages new mums as they get to grips with breastfeeding during the early days. The network provides much-needed guidance and advice for mothers who may otherwise be unsure about even starting to breastfeed. Those services are replicated in various parts of the country and many are in Sure Start centres. I have had the great pleasure of visiting many breastfeeding support groups in those centres and I have seen their great work. I would love every new mother across the UK to have access to such services because that support makes a huge difference as we have all attested today. Sadly as we have seen across the country in recent years Sure Start centres are closing. More than 700 have closed since 2010 which limits the amount of support that mothers can get. What assessment have the Government made of the number of support services that have been lost as a result of the closure of more than 700 Sure Start centres?National Breastfeeding Week is a brilliant idea and over the years it has successfully highlighted across the world the importance of breastfeeding. I fully endorse and support the campaign and I hope this debate will go some way towards making even more people aware of the virtues of breastfeeding. As we have heard numerous studies have shown breastfeeding to be the healthiest way to feed a baby. Not only does breastfeedingprovide essential nutrients and sustenance it also greatly reduces the risk of a baby developing health problems such as gastroenteritis asthma diabetes and obesity. Furthermore breastfeeding helps to protect women from breast and ovarian cancer. The World Health Organisation is unequivocal that if possible babies should be totally breastfed until they are at least six months old. On top of all that there is the additional bonus that breast milk from source is always at the right temperature for babies with no bottles needing to be sterilised. Best of all it is 100% free. Breastfeeding is cheap; it is good for babies; it comes highly recommended; and by preventing illnesses it keeps babies safe while saving millions of pounds from stretched NHS budgets. Put simply what is not to like?Unfortunately despite all of the positives that other Members and I have outlined today certain obstacles remain for mothers who are looking to breastfeed their children. One such obstacle comes when mothers return to work after maternity leave. Breastfeeding mothers face a heightened sense of anxiety when they return to work from maternity leave as they have the additional worry of how their baby will be fed in their absence. The hon. Member for Glasgow Central and other hon. Members spoke of their personal experience. Women may have to raise with their employer the issues of expressing and storing breast milk and fitting in feeds around their work and lunch hour. If they harbour fears that their employer lacks an understanding of or concern about such accommodations it may delay their return to work or stop their return altogether. Alternatively such fears may make women give up breastfeeding sooner than they had planned.Maternity discrimination such as prohibiting mothers from breastfeeding in caf&#233;s or restaurants is now against the law under the Equality Act 2010 but the Act does not apply in the workplace. Mothers can be told not to express milk or be denied breastfeeding breaks. Employers do not have to provide facilities for breast milk to be expressed or stored. Good employers provide such facilities but they do not have to do so. I can tell hon. Members as the Health and Safety Executive already has that toilets are no place for expressing milk or breastfeeding. We all want parents to get back to work if they wish to do so. I hope the Government understand that breastfeeding responsibilities are holding mothers back from returning to work and I hope the Minister will assure us that he is looking into ways to address that issue.Over the past few years we have seen that women in general are finding it harder at work. There were more unemployed women over the past five years than at any time under the previous Labour Government and real wages for women have fallen year on year since 2010. There has also been a dramatic fall in sexual discrimination and pregnancy discrimination cases made against employers since women were priced out of justice when expensive tribunal fees were introduced. Figures comparing the years before and after the introduction of those fees show a truly staggering 91% fall in sex discrimination cases and a 46% fall in pregnancy discrimination cases. Such dramatic falls are utterly unacceptable in a country that wants to treat women with respect in the workplace. A Labour Government would have scrapped those unfair barriers to justice. I would love to hear the Minister say that his Government will reverse that unfair policy.Alongside the structural issues affecting breastfeeding there is a growing cultural obstacle that prevents new mums from breastfeeding their children. It is particularly striking as we have heard in working-class communities. The Department for Health figures show that in Brighton almost 70% of new mothers were partially or totally breastfeeding at six to eight weeks&#8212;that is relatively early to be taking a measure given that the recommendation is that children should be breastfed for up to six months but we can use it as a comparison&#8212;while in Hartlepool and south Tyneside the figure falls to 19.3% and 22.6% respectively.In some communities today there seems to be an anti-breastfeeding culture among young mothers which we need to challenge and reverse. National Breastfeeding Week and this debate are great ways of starting to do that. Breastfeeding must be seen as normal and natural and new mothers should feel utterly comfortable doing it. We need to focus on the areas and communities in which new mums do not even consider starting to breastfeed because it seems so strange or even repulsive to them. Government support is required. Role models must come forward to extol the virtues of breastfeeding and we need more mums on TV&#8212;[Interruption.] Hon. Members may laugh. We need mums in our soaps and even on &#8220;The Only Way is Essex&#8221; breastfeeding naturally and happily. We rarely see breastfeeding and if we do it is usually by mums such as us&#8212;middle class professional older mums&#8212;which reinforces the image in some young mums&#8217; minds that breastfeeding is something for a certain type of people not for them and their friends.We need to work to reverse that image and let new mums and young mums know that breastfeeding is not only good for their health and that of their babies but it has immediate benefits such as helping them lose their pregnancy weight much faster as the hon. Member for Glasgow Central said. I was never as slim as when I was breastfeeding my children. If I could have carried on breastfeeding I would because the weight really drops off. It also means not having to get cold in the middle of the night making up bottles and it helps mums to bond in such a special way with their babies which cannot be imagined until it has been experienced.Come on TV producers soap writers celebrities and &#8220;TOWIE&#8221; stars watching this debate&#8212;get to it. Get breastfeeding on TV and get mums seeing it. I want mums to feel comfortable in public&#8212;even in Claridge&#8217;s for goodness&#8217; sake. We need to show that it is totally normal natural and acceptable and that those who have a problem with it simply need to get over it.I once again thank the hon. Member for Glasgow Central for securing this important debate and for all she has said and done on this issue in the short time she has been in this House. I thank the other hon. Members for coming along and making their expert contributions. I have rarely heard such strong and powerful arguments for the benefits of breastfeeding and I thank every hon. Member who came to speak here today. I am sure that with such powerful advocacy from hon. Members and from groups and organisations throughout the country National Breastfeeding Week will be a huge success in raising even greater awareness among parents.I hope that the Government will listen to the concerns about women getting back into work after having a baby and will address the specific issues that affect them to ensure that that transition is best for both the motherand her baby. We all want to see the best outcomes for all parties but only by taking action to help can we see progress. Simply hoping for the best will not be enough so for the sake of babies their mums and our society in general let us hope for a successful awareness campaign and an equally successful response from the Government.To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a comparative assessment of the levels of financial support available under the current system of employer-supported childcare and tax-free childcare for a (a) single parent paying the basic rate of tax who has one child and who spends under &#163;4500 per annum on childcare (b) single parent paying the higher rate of tax who has one child and who spends under &#163;3000 per annum on childcare (c) single parent paying the basic rate of tax who has two children and who spends under &#163;4500 per annum on childcare (d) single parent paying the higher rate of tax who has two children and who spends under &#163;3000 per annum on childcare (e) two-parent household paying the basic rate of tax which has one child and which spends under &#163;9000 per annum on childcare (f) two-parent household paying the higher rate of tax which has one child and which spends under &#163;6000 per annum on childcare (g) two-parent household paying the basic rate of tax which has two children and which spends under &#163;9000 per annum on childcare and (h) two-parent household paying the higher rate of tax which has two children and which spends under &#163;6000 per annum on childcare.When I first heard the original motion&#8212;I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter) on this&#8212;I was absolutely astonished. The motion made me wonder what other ethnic groups and races could be grouped together and framed in a debate about their effect on local communities. I would like to think that such language was a thing of the distant past so I was surprised to say the least that the House had allowed the original motion. I am pleased that the wording of the motion has been changed albeit to wording that is only slightly better.I hope we can use this debate to put to bed some of the myths or stereotypes about these communities and promote greater cohesion between the many ethnic communities in our country. I understand and appreciate some of the concerns that have been raised in this debate but I counsel caution to Members present about grouping together different ethnic groups as a homogeneous whole.In this country Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers are both legally recognised ethnic minority groups with rich cultures and traditions that go back centuries. They are groups with people as varied as in any other country and it is entirely wrong not to mention counterproductive to the desired outcomes of many Members here&#8212;especially the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) who secured the debate&#8212;to stigmatise such groups and to seek to create further barriers between them and other parts of society.Many of the problems that have arisen and that have been highlighted in this debate are structural issues that need our attention. There is a serious shortage of legal Traveller sites in England as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith said and on current trends it will take decades for that deficiency to be rectified. This situation has forced thousands of Gypsies and Travellers on to illegal pitches which not only annoys some local communities and further stigmatises Gypsies and Travellers in the eyes of many people but harms the Travellers and Gypsies themselves particularly their children.Again the hon. Gentleman is making some valid points. This issue is about rights and responsibilities and as a community and a country we have a responsibility to Gypsies and Travellers to ensure that there are legal places where they can live. They have rights and the responsibility as all residents and UK citizens do to treat those places&#8212;their homes&#8212;with the respect they deserve. However we have come to a downward spiral which is not helping anyone; it is not helping the local residents and it is certainly not helping the Gypsies and Travellers.As I was saying children in the Traveller communities already suffer high levels of racial abuse with nine out of 10 of them experiencing such abuse according to 2014 figures. We need to do all we can to help these people and putting additional pressure on them will only make matters worse deepening the divisions when we need to be building bridges. All people in this country should obey the rule of law but equally all people in this country should be respected and respect is what the Gypsy and Traveller communities require more than most. Only by giving them such respect can we bring about the positive changes that we all want.The Government and civil society need to work towards boosting community cohesion and towards promoting a greater dialogue and further understanding between Gypsies and Travellers and the rest of society. The Government must also recognise that dealing with these communities is a two-way street and that it is only when we all work together in a joint atmosphere of respect and tolerance that we can hope to come together and put an end to many of the problems that appear to divide so many of us.All local communities should be able to live in peace and that goes for Travellers and Gypsies as well so I hope that all Members here today will bear that in mind and will work with these communities rather than against them putting aside divisive rhetoric and entering into discussions with open minds"},

Estimates based on survey data are subject to uncertainty due to sampling error and remaining non-response error.The figures quoted in this response represent point estimates with 95 per cent confidence intervals i.e. given the size and structure of the sample we are 95 per cent confident that the number of people in Yorkshire and Humber with a sight impairment is 140000 (+/- 40000) and the number with a hearing impairment is 190000 (+/- 40000).The Family Resources Survey covers private households only so does not record information on individuals in for example nursing or retirement homes. This means that figures relating to older people or others who have moved into homes where they can receive more frequent help may not be representative of the United Kingdom population. Therefore it is likely that disability prevalence for those who do not reside in a private household is higher than estimated from the FRS.Figures have been rounded to the nearest ten thousand.I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow South West (Chris Stephens) on securing this important Adjournment debate and all the other Members who have contributed in it. My office took particular interest in this one. I also congratulate him on his 25 years of work in public service his role as vice-chair of the PCS parliamentary group and his interest in DWP and its valuable work.DWP is the largest Government Department with a pay bill of &#163;2.5 billion in 2015-16. The Department employs more than 84000 staff who work in various locations across the country and serve more than 22 million claimants and customers some of whom are the most vulnerable in society. When I have spoken about that before many of my colleagues have been surprised because a lot of MPs are not aware of just how vast the organisation is and the diversity of work we do in job centre networks benefit centres and the corporate services. For example we support people to find work develop policy pay pensions and investigate fraud. The Department is delivering substantial welfare reform changes including the roll-out of universal credit the introduction of personal independent payment and pension reforms while meeting our efficiency challenges.We appreciate the professionalism and contribution of DWP employees in continuing to deliver those changes. The results of their efforts have included a new record high UK employment rate of 73.7%; unemployment at a seven-year low of 5.3%; an employment rate for young people who have left full-time education up at 74.3% the highest in more than a decade; and a reduction in operating cost of &#163;1.9 billion since 2009-10. I have made many trips around the country to meet those front-line DWP staff and to see the great work that they do with great professionalism. Tomorrow I am off to Blackpool as part of my visits when I am going to see the work being done on PIP. I am sure that hon. Members from all parts of the House will join me in acknowledging the hard work and contribution of the dedicated DWP staff.In 2010 the country was facing tough economic challenges and the Government had to make some difficult decisions in order to address the country&#8217;s huge budget deficit. As was the case across Europe public sector pay restraint was part of the overall approach taken to reducing the deficit. That was not unique to the public sector; not only did many workers in the private sector also face pay freezes but some faced pay cuts. As a Government Department DWP has to comply with the Government public sector pay policy to set pay awards in line with Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury and Cabinet Office guidelines.Let me now deal specifically with our Department&#8217;s approach. Since 2010 DWP has focused on increasing the pay of its lowest paid. In the emergency Budget of 2010 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a two-year pay freeze for those in the civil service earning more than &#163;21000. But crucially for those earning under &#163;210 DWP took advantage of the flexibility and opted to pay more than the minimum &#163;250 flat-rate increase proposed in HMT guidance. DWP actually provided awards ranging from &#163;400 to &#163;540. In 2010 it also increased the base salary of the lowest grade by &#163;890. The pay freeze was followed by an annual pay remit of 1% on consolidated pay increases for the remainder of the last Parliament. During that time DWP pay negotiations included discussions on how best to distribute the available funding. DWP opted to pay the majority of its staff a 1% increase each year but continued to focus on increasing the pay of its lowest paid through higher base salary increases&#8212;for example 3% in 2014 and 2.5% in 2015.In addition Departments have flexibility over how they allocate their non-consolidated performance payments. DWP is the only large Department that pays this to the majority of its employees distributing on the basis of grade and performance marking. This year DWP allocated performance awards of between &#163;450 to &#163;750 to junior staff.I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention but all good things come to those who wait patiently. I am only part way through my contribution and I have already addressed some of the points but more is to come.Pay and allowances are part of the total reward package. Employees also benefit from a package including a staff discount scheme generous annual leave entitlement and a defined benefit pension scheme.On the point about equality DWP has one of the lowest gender pay gaps in Whitehall. It currently stands at 3.4%. Typically it is rated at 5%. If an organisation or body is below 5% they are making progress. The Department is committed further to improve that through the introduction of a range of measures including name-blind recruitment and female representation on senior recruitment panels. This is something that we take very seriously and we are proud to be leading as a Department in that area.Let me turn now to the future. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in this year&#8217;s Budget that the Government will fund the public sector workforce for a pay award of 1% for the length of this Parliament. Each year DWP negotiates with PCS and other unions on their pay awards and that will continue for future pay deals.DWP already provides a range of support for people who require assistance to fill in job applications and to attend job interviews.Programmes such as Work Choice Work Programme and the new Specialist Employability Support offer tailored support for any participants who need help with their jobseeking. This may include help with activities such as filling in job applications and attending job interviews. Access to Work can provide practical support for people who need help with attending interviews due to a health condition or disability.Jobcentre Plus continues to offer a range of support including a free helpline for claimants who have difficulty making their claims for benefit online because of dyslexia or a similar conditions and Claimant Computer Suites manned by Jobcentre Plus Customer Service staff. In addition a Jobcentre Plus Work Coach or where appropriate a Disability Employment Adviser (DEA) can signpost claimants to local sources of support such as Work Clubs third sector organisations or the National Careers Service.The Department is constantly seeking ways to improve these services but at present there are no plans to fund additional support nationally. However the support we provide nationally both complements and is complemented by our engagement with support provided locally by stakeholders such as third sector organisations local councils Work Clubs and other partners.We are also exploring innovative new ways to deliver support. For example the Personalisation Pathfinders project running in three Jobcentre Plus Districts which will test a new localised approach to helping people with Disabilities and long term health conditions.The information requested to answer the three questions above is shown in the table below for February 2015 which is the latest data available.Pension Credit Claimants with a Carer's additional amount by age and gender for Great Britain Scotland Glasgow City Local Authority and Glasgow East constituency - February 2015All PersonsAge of claimantGreat BritainScotlandGlasgow City LAGlasgow East ConstituencyTotal all Ages20974022340349075060----6110---6233.40361E+125.1073E+133.109E+131.2085E+136.1092E+1309097017040MaleAge of claimantGreat BritainScotlandGlasgow City LAGlasgow East ConstituencyTotal all Ages13254013330197040060----61----62201019040-6347.50431E+124.30541E+128.70491E+121.70521E+124605409020FemaleAge of claimantGreat BritainScotlandGlasgow City LAGlasgow East ConstituencyTotal all Ages772009152035060----61----6213.3017E+127.60291E+128.80361E+122.60361E+124.40401E+126304208020Source: DWP 100% data.Notes:1. - denotes nil or negligible; Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest ten; some additional disclosure control has also been applied.

Under current legislation State Pension age for women will equalise with State Pension age for men at 65 in 2018. Both men's and women's State Pension age will increase from 65 to 66 between December 2018 and October 2020. The Pensions Bill 2013-14 contains provision for a State Pension age of 67 to be reached by 2028.

Parliamentary Constituency of claimant (Westminster) these constituencies are used for the Westminster parliament4. Information for Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Department for Social Development. Northern Ireland statistics can be found at:http://www.dsdni.gov.uk/index/stats_and_research/benefit_publications.htmThe Government is committed to giving disabled people the opportunity to fulfil their potential and achieve their ambitions. Work is an important part of this. That is why we have committed to halving the disability employment gap requiring us to transform policy practice and public attitudes.We must build on recent progress. We have already:- extended Access to Work to provide support to more disabled people in pre-employment such as work experience and also to undertake employment-based training such as supported internships traineeships and self-arranged work experience.- launched Specialist Employability Support an innovative new programme which provides intensive specialist support to the disabled people who need the most help.- continued to work with employers through our Disability Confident campaign to ensure that they understand the benefits of recruiting and retaining disabled people in work.- announced new funding in the Budget of up to &#163;100m per year for additional practical support to provide the right incentives and support to enable those who have limited capability but who have some potential to prepare for work to move closer to the labour market and when they are ready back into work.- committed to spending &#163;43m over the next 3 years to develop the evidence base on what works for those with common mental health conditions retain and return to employment. This will be done through a range of voluntary mental health and employment pilots that will go live next yearWe set up the Work and Health unit in the summer to bring together the Work and Health agendas to help disabled people and people with health conditions get into work stay in work and return to work with the right support and we are developing our plans in this area.The Government will set out it its spending plans for this Parliament in the forthcoming Spending Review.We expect to be able to form a reliable estimate once a significant proportion of working-age Disability Living Allowance recipients have been reassessed for the Personal Independence Payment. Over 1.75 million claimants require reassessing; as of July 2015 circa 186900 had been reassessed.As referenced in our previous reply of 16 September 2015 DWP will continue to pay DLA for four weeks after the decision not to pay PIP enhanced mobility component is made. The Motability charity has confirmed that claimants can keep their car for up to three weeks after DLA payments end. This means that claimants will retain their car for up to nearly two months even though they are not entitled to PIP enhanced mobility component.In addition the Department has worked closely with Motability to ensure that those claimants who no longer meet the criteria for the mobility scheme are supported through the transitional period. For most of these claimants who entered into their first lease agreement with Motability before January 2013 Motability will provide transitional support of &#163;2000. This will enable many claimants to continue to meet their mobility needs by purchasing a used car. For claimants who entered into their first lease agreement with the scheme after January 2013 and up to December 2013 Motability will supply transitional support of &#163;1000 to assist with mobility costs.We are committed to supporting small and micro-businesses to adapt to their new automatic enrolment duties. Together with The Pensions Regulator we have launched a new broadcast-led communications campaign to raise awareness of automatic enrolment amongst small employers.The Pensions Regulator has also recently launched a new interactive and simplified online step by step guide to automatic enrolment designed to meet the specific needs of employers who may not have pensions experience including those with just one or two staff. Employers using the website can access tailored information relevant to their circumstances. The Pensions Regulator also provides online content for business advisers who play an important role in supporting smaller employers to meet their legal duties. To raise awareness and understanding the Regulator has had over 500 meetings with intermediary firms and spoken at over 300 events around the UK during the last yearThe Regulator sends a series of letters to every employer starting at least 12 months before their staging date which is the date that the law applies to them. These letters set out what an employer needs to do and by when to comply with the law and signposts to the relevant information on the Regulator&#8217;s website.To help employers adjust to the costs of automatic enrolment the minimum employer contribution level starts at 1% and increases gradually to 3% by October 2018. In addition to ensure that all firms have access to quality low-cost pension provision The National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) was established by the Government and has a public service obligation to accept any employer that chooses NEST for automatic enrolment."},
    {"label":"Justine Greening","value":"I am grateful to the right hon. Lady and to you, Mr Speaker, for giving the House the chance to discuss this important matter today. As the House will be aware, more refugees made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean into Europe last month than in the whole of 2014. Indeed, in October 218,000 people crossed the Mediterranean, bringing the total for the year so far to more than 750,000. Greece and the Balkan states have borne the majority of that burden and although the response is being led by the Governments of those countries, the UK has led the way in supporting them and has provided essential humanitarian assistance across Greece and the west Balkans. That was part of the EU Ministers meeting that I attended last Monday, where we also discussed the issue of migration.In September, anticipating the impact of the colder winter months, we released &#163;11.5 million of life-saving aid for refugees in Europe, in the Balkans and in Turkey. This past weekend, I announced a further &#163;5 million to provide sleeping bags, hygiene kits, nappies, food and clean water for people in need in Greece, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia and Croatia. In total, the UK has committed nearly &#163;25 million to support refugees arriving in Europe as well as those on the journey in north Africa. We continue to respond to the requests that have been made. I recently approved a UK contribution to the EU civil protection mechanism, which deals with requests for in-kind assistance from other European countries. Of course, that is alongside the support that my Department has given in the Syria region over the past four years.A total of &#163;1.1 billion makes us the second largest donor country and that support has enabled the vast majority of Syrians affected by the crisis and displaced to stay in the region rather than feeling that they need to make the journey to Europe. Only a tiny fraction of the total number of displaced Syrians have therefore sought asylum in Europe and without the UK&#8217;s humanitarian response, that number would have been far higher. Of course, we continue closely to monitor the situation across Europe and we will consider further support as needs emerge.The right hon. Lady raises some very important points, which I and my Department have spent many years working on directly. She is right to set out the desperation that leads so many of those people to try and make what can, in some cases, be a fatal journey from the Syrian region to Europe. I can announce to the House that having been in touch with Frontex to offer further support, the UK will as of Thursday deploy a new ship to help provide search and rescue facilities in the Mediterranean. That offer has been accepted so VOS Grace will be part of that effort, which is good news. It is worth reflecting that the support from the UK by means of Border Force cutters and Royal Navy ships has saved over 8,000 lives to date.The right hon. Lady is right about the need to press European partners to do more. We can be proud of the work that we as a country have done to help people affected by the crisis in Syria and latterly as they have arrived in Europe. That is not just the work I spoke about in relation to saving lives in the Mediterranean; we have provided asylum for thousands of people and, as I have just set out, we are actively helping key agencies on the ground, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Red Cross and the International Organisation for Migration. The right hon. Lady is right to highlight the fact that more needs to be done. That was precisely the point I made in Luxembourg last Monday at an EU Ministers meeting. Britain cannot do this work on our own. We can be proud of the work that we are doing&#8212;no country in Europe has done more&#8212;but we need other European states to join the effort, and I very much welcome the right hon. Lady&#8217;s highlighting of the issue through her own efforts.The hon. Lady raises important issues. The point I made at the EU Ministers meeting last week is that this is an issue of European credibility. We have been in New York signing off on new global goals, we have a world humanitarian summit coming up next May and the UK has been at the leading edge of providing support to people affected by this crisis. It is important that when people arrive on Europe&#8217;s shore they are effectively taken care of. I have set out some of the work that the UK is doing, but it is vital that other EU member states play their role alongside our efforts.In relation to people-smuggling, some of the work that our ships in the Mediterranean have done is not just to save lives but to catch some of the potential people smugglers. The deployment of VOS Grace later this week will enable all that work to continue. The hon. Lady is right to highlight that this is an important part of how we tackle the refugee crisis. It is not just about providing support to people; it is also about tackling the criminality that is at the heart of the situation. Many of these people have been conned into giving away their life savings and any remaining assets they have to be told that they can possibly make a new life for themselves in Europe, but by going on a boat that may never get them to where they want to get to. It is important that we tackle the criminality. That is why it is important that the vulnerable persons relocation scheme works as it does. We are enabling people to relocate without having to put their lives in the hands of a people smuggler in the first place. That is a safer, more secure route, but crucially it also enables us to target the people who are the most vulnerable in the camps and in host communities who have been affected by this crisis and who would probably never have the means or the capacity even to begin such a journey in the first place.We have said that during this Parliament we will relocate and support up to 20,000 people to come to the UK. I can assure the hon. Lady that we are on track with our initial resettlement of 1,000 people by Christmas.The support we provide is very much driven by the needs set out to us by the agencies and non-governmental organisations with which we work.I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman that we have provided tents&#8212;for example, in Croatia&#8212;and we are playing our role in helping to make sure that when people arrive at reception centres, they are dealt with and processed properly.As the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) set out, there is a real issue of scale, and Britain cannot solve that on its own. It is worth emphasising to the House that each of the countries where refugees are arriving is leading the response in that country, so it is up to UN agencies and NGOs to work as part of a national response by each country. As I have set out, Britain is also supporting those countries in order to have an adequate response. As the House has heard, there are real challenges, given the scale of the numbers and the flow of refugees who are arriving on European shores.The hon. Gentleman talked about the UK taking its fair proportion. The reality is that we can be proud of the work the UK is doing to support refugees affected by the Syrian crisis&#8212;whether it is the work we are doing in the Mediterranean to save lives, the thousands of people who have been given asylum already, the approach we now have of relocating people from the camps safely and securely, or the kind of support closer to home that I have set out today. No country in Europe is doing more than the UK, and the House should be proud of that.We are having a range of discussions to see how the situation can be better managed in Europe. This is not just about the challenge we face in the Syria region. Frankly, that challenge is to have the kind of support at the scale needed, but which is currently not being delivered. I have seen for myself from discussions among EU Ministers from countries in the Schengen region that there is very little agreement. What we need, in effect, is a co-ordinated approach within the Schengen region, but as far as I could see at the time&#8212;this was certainly the case last Monday&#8212;there was no political prospect of achieving that.Although such discussions need to go on, the UK is right to provide additional support on the ground. However, we clearly all need to keep in mind the key objective, which is to help Syrian refugees in the region. People are leaving the region because food rations from the World Food Programme are starting to be cut, and because they are worried about how their children will have an education when so few Syrian children can be in school, in spite of the best efforts of countries such as the UK. We were instrumental in setting up the No Lost Generation initiative, through which many children are in school, and we are working with the World Bank to look at how to have better livelihood programmes. There is no doubt that the answer involves, first, some political resolution&#8212;ultimately&#8212;in Syria, and secondly, some political resolution in Europe, too.The continued mandate of the Turkish Government means that there is some stability in terms of the partners we have been working with. It remains to be seen whether there will be policy changes for how Turkey chooses to deal with what is now a huge number of refugees in its midst.The hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes) asked a question on safe zones, which I did not answer at the time. Although safe zones may seem appealing, getting them in place effectively with UN backing, and enabling them to be delivered safely for people on the ground, is key. We never want to put people in the position that they faced in Srebrenica, for example, where they thought they were in a safe zone, but which proved fatally not to be the case. There is anecdotal evidence of refugees being worried that if safe zones are set up, they may be forced back over the border into Syria, and that is possibly one reason why some refugees are leaving the camps and making the journey to Europe. I assure the House that we are considering all possible means to ensure that we protect vulnerable refugees, but we also have a responsibility not to create a situation that could put people in even more danger.On 26 October, I attended the Foreign Affairs Council for Development in Luxembourg. The meeting was chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini. She also hosted a joint lunch with Environment Minister to discuss the implementation of the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030. A provisional report of the meeting and Conclusions adopted will be deposited in the Library of the House for the convenience of members.Humanitarian Affairs The Council discussed how the EU could play a leading role at the forthcoming World Humanitarian Summit. A notable common thread was on the need for a new approach to funding; more genuine partnerships with affected governments, the private sector, civil society and diaspora; and the need for innovation. I led calls for better enforcement of International Humanitarian Law to protect civilians; a reformed approach to finance, blending public and private approaches and moving beyond initial emergency response to focus on education and livelihoods; and a bold approach to gender equality in humanitarian action, including a global coordinated approach to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. In addition to the exchange of views, Commission Vice President Georgieva presented the work of the UN High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing.Migration, refugees and developmentThe Council discussion focussed largely on preparation for the forthcoming Valletta Summit, and in particular the Emergency Trust Fund which was intended to be a key deliverable for the Summit. I emphasized the UK&#8217;s view that the Summit needs to demonstrate Europe&#8217;s credibility, leadership, and commitment to respond quickly to the serious problems posed by migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The UK has taken a leading role in pressing for a substantive discussion on tackling the root causes of migration, a mutual challenge faced by Europe and Africa &#8211; a lack of growth, jobs, opportunity in African countries &#8211; and the concrete actions needed to turn the situation around. I emphasised the need to review the Commission&#8217;s existing financial instruments to ensure they are flexible and fit for purpose for a rapid response to ongoing crises. I also pressed other Member States to step up their own financial commitments to address the Syria crisis, alongside UK leadership.Gender Action PlanThe Council adopted Conclusions on the new Gender Action Plan (2015-2020) (GAP), which the UK has been a key actor in shaping. I welcomed the new GAP as a landmark opportunity for the EU to take significant steps forward in delivering tangible results for women and girls across the world and pressed for its full implementation. EU-Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) relationship (&#8220;Post-Cotonou&#8221;) The Council also discussed the future of the EU&#8217;s relationship with the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states), with the expiry of the existing Cotonou Partnership Agreement set for 2020. This is an important opportunity for the EU to modernise its relationship with the ACP, so that it is relevant, forward-looking and consistent with Agenda 2030. I called for the Commission to have a broad review, base policy decisions on the evidence of Cotonou&#8217;s impact and actively seek a wide range of views during the consultation period.Implementation of the Agenda 2030During lunch, in a joint session with Environment Ministers, we discussed the implementation of the recently-agreed 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development (the Post-2015 Development Framework). I emphasized the importance of looking at the implementation of the Agenda 2030 alongside the other major processes - including the mid-term reviews of the financial instruments and the Cotonou Agreement &#8211; occurring over the next five years.Any other businessThe Council adopted several sets of Council Conclusions, including on Afghanistan; the Horn of Africa Action Plan; and the 2015 Report on Policy Coherence for Development. In addition, the decision to open consultation with Burundi on restrictive measures under the EU-ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) Partnership Agreement was also approved. Details of these Council conclusions will also be placed in the Library of the House.On 26 October, I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council for Development in Luxembourg. The meeting will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini. This is the first Council meeting since the new Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030, which the UK played a strong leadership role in shaping, was adopted by world leaders at the post-2015 Summit in September. As Secretary of State for International Development, I look forward to participating in the meeting to share the UK experience, including on humanitarian issues and improving the lives of girls and women, and to work with other Member States and the Commission to deliver the new Global Goals by 2030. The UK&#8217;s continued focus on international development is very much in the national interest.Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030I will strongly welcome and underline the UK&#8217;s continued commitment to championing and implementing the Global Goals. Building on the Prime Minister&#8217;s co-chairing of the UN High Level Panel, the UK played a key role in creating a set of goals that are universal and inclusive, underpinned by a commitment to leave no one behind. The new Global Goals address the key elements of the &#8220;golden thread&#8221;, including peace, governance and justice and also an unprecedented ambitious Goal on Women and Girls empowerment. The UK will continue to invest 0.7% of GNI on ODA and I will lobby others to meet their aid obligations. I will push the EU to come up with a comprehensive and ambitious plan for implementation.Migration and RefugeesMinisters will discuss preparations of the EU Africa Valletta Summit in November. It is the UK&#8217;s view that Valetta needs to demonstrate Europe&#8217;s leadership, commitment and ability to respond quickly to the serious problems posed by migrants crossing the Mediterranean. I believe Valletta needs a substantive discussion on tackling the root causes of migration, which are a mutual challenge faced by Europe and Africa &#8211; a lack of growth, jobs, opportunity in African countries &#8211; and the concrete actions needed to turn the situation around. The UK has been taking a leading role in ensuring that Valetta will address the underlying causes of migration and displacement. I will continue to press the Commission and other Member States to ensure that we approach Valletta with a positive and bold agenda.World Humanitarian SummitMinisters will discuss next year&#8217;s World Humanitarian Summit. I will strongly welcome the Summit, underlining the need to be ambitious and deliver genuinely transformative change. The UK&#8217;s key priorities are: (1) a focus on the protection of civilians and International Humanitarian Law, (2) building resilience to natural disasters, (3) a new approach to smart finance, (4) a strong focus on women and girls throughout the Summit. The Summit must deliver significant reforms to the way in which we address humanitarian crises, in particular those associated with long-term conflict. I am particularly concerned to ensure that we leave Istanbul with a better approach to supporting long-term refugees: they must be able to access livelihoods and education if they are to have hope for the future. The UK is committed to longer term financing for protracted crises, such as our work in Syria.Girls and womenOn girls and women, as successfully with the Global Goals, the UK has been a key actor in shaping and developing the new Gender Action Plan (2016-2020) (GAP). I have continuously pushed for girls and women to be prioritised in the new Commission. Moreover the UK&#8217;s important role in the GAP Taskforce has ensured the document demonstrates a significant shift in the Commissions commitment to girls and women. The publication of the new EU GAP provides a landmark opportunity for the EU to take significant steps forward in delivering tangible results for women and girls across the world. The Council will endorse the new GAP at the FAC-DEV. I will press for its full implementation, ensuring that the Commission and EEAS are held accountable when and where the GAP is not implemented.Post-CotonouThe Commission and European External Action Service (EEAS) have launched an online public consultation on the future of EU-ACP (Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific) relations once the Cotonou agreement expires in 2020. This is an important opportunity for the EU to modernise its relationship with the ACP, so that it is relevant, forward-looking and consistent with Agenda 2030. I will call for the Commission to keep all options open, base policy decisions on the evidence of Cotonou&#8217;s impact and actively seek a broad range of views during the consultation period, including with individual states and regional bodies that are inside and outside the ACP grouping.Council Conclusions and other agenda itemsCouncil Conclusions on the Gender Action Plan and Policy Coherence for Development will be approved. In addition, three AOB topics have been tabled: (1) Burkina Faso, (2) a joint letter from the Netherlands, France and Germany calling for a European initiative to support African Youth and (3) Capacity Building for Security and Development."},
    {"label":"Nick Brown","value":"It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) in this debate. I listened carefully to what he said about the issues of importance to his constituents and it struck me that the issues of importance to my constituents are very different. The Budget has been presented to us as a Budget for working people and a one nation Budget because we are all in this together but I have to say to those on the Government Front Bench that it just will not be seen in that way in the north-east of England.I have no quarrel with the Government&#8217;s desire to drive up wages to increase productivity and to broaden and deepen the private sector employment base in the north-east of England but we do not think that those things will actually happen. We believe that we will getall the welfare expenditure cuts but not the increased wages or the longer working hours or the chance to earn a living in the private sector marketplace.The maximum grants for students from households with incomes below &#163;250 which encourage youngsters to go to university are being converted into loans. In my constituency one elector in five is a student. The change will mean that those in the very poorest households will be the ones leaving university with the highest debts and that just does not seem fair. Similarly the assault on working families tax credits will penalise the working poor. That point was very well made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)In fairness Mr Deputy Speaker I took the intervention but I accept what you say.There is an issue for those who rely on working families tax credits and who are in relatively low-paid jobs in the north-east of England. Let us take the example of a lone parent with two children who is working 16 hours a week on the minimum wage. Once both changes have come into place the Chancellor&#8217;s living wage announcement makes up about &#163;400 which is just under half the &#163;860 that person would lose from the tax credit change. I listened to the earlier exchange between the Front-Bench teams. I take into account what was said and accept that it might ameliorate the position; none the less the change is shown in the Red Book as a saving to the Exchequer which means that it is money that my constituents get now but will not be getting in the future.The reduction in the employment and support allowance to jobseeker&#8217;s allowance levels will not help anyone find a job; it just makes them poorer. The public sector pay freeze of 1% for the next four years is on top of a public pay policy that saw a freeze for two years from 2011 then below-inflation settlements of 1% up to the current financial year. This will be the longest sustained public sector pay freeze ever and it is just not fair on the workers especially the low-paid public sector workers. The benefit tapers have been narrowed and on top of all that there is the benefits cap itself. I am not against the cap in principle but reducing it from &#163;26000 to &#163;23000 in London and imposing a lower regional ceiling of &#163;20000 outside London is harsh on the English regions.The Chancellor has burdened housing associations with an unwanted right to buy which is good for the few but not for the many. Local authority housing stock is still burdened by the bedroom tax which is not just unjust but actually counter-productive in communities such as my own constituency where a private one-bedroom bedsit in Jesmond costs more to rent than a two-bedroom council flat in Walker. Yet full housing benefit will go tothe one-bedroom flat and those in the two-bedroom local authority- owned flat will be penalised by &#163;8 a week. I do not see how any of this helps the north-east. Certainly it does not help to make work pay.In some parts of the country it may be reasonable to argue that employers should pay better wages rather than rely on the state to top them up but the danger for the north-east is that those who rely on working families tax credit will not be able to get extra hours at work to make up for the shortfall in their weekly income and will not be able to get a pay rise because there is not sufficient profitability in the business for that to be sustained.The even greater irony is that I was the Government Chief Whip when we put through the minimum wage legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) was the Whip on the Committee that went right through the night on this. But that is going down memory lane. Indeed it was the current Secretary of State for Defence who was making the case in the Committee at the time. There was some substance in the point which is why I make it now in relation to the specific circumstances of the constrained nature of the private sector economy in the north-east of England. A broader deeper and stronger private sector economy is the way forward for our region. It will help to give us the wages and the breadth of job opportunities that the south-east of England enjoys.The great hope offered by the Government to the north-east is in their northern powerhouse initiative. The Chancellor is right to take regional policy seriously but he just does not seem to understand how the north-east of England works and what precisely it needs. Indeed he did not reference us once in his Budget speech when he was going through the offers to the other English regions. The only practical manifestation of the Government&#8217;s northern powerhouse policy so far is in the rail upgrades and they have been delayed.When I was the regional Minister in the previous Labour Government I met representatives of Hitachi in Downing Street. They were considering locating in the north-east of England and wanted to discuss how they could bring that about. I give credit to the current Government for having seen that programme through because it does involve Government support and they could have cancelled it but they did not. But it was a shared endeavour and it was certainly coming into place well before the northern powerhouse initiative.However the hon. Gentleman is quite right that it is exactly the sort of initiative that we would like to see for our region. If it comes under the northern powerhouse brand I shall take no exception to that.The problem is that we do not know the geographical boundaries of the northern powerhouse initiative or the functions ascribed to it. We do not even know whether it is some form of local government reorganisation or a regional economic development initiative or both. We are being told in the north-east that we must sign up to a metro mayor but not why. The Government have given no details of the powers functions workings accountability or budget for the post yet they say we must have one.The past five years have seen a plethora of initiatives that have had no practical impact on the problems in the north-east. The new local enterprise partnerships simply do not have the resources and capacity to address the scale of the problems. The LEPs have been followed by city deals enterprise zones regional growth funds local growth deals and joint leadership boards. They are fragmented piecemeal initiatives that collectively do not amount to an effective focused regional policy from the Government. Metro mayors risk being just the latest addition to this confused approach. There is a serious question as to whether so many proposed policy responsibilities can and should be invested in one single individual. People in Newcastle who rejected the local government version of the elected mayor in 2012 and the wider north-east should at the very least be given a choice on this in a referendum.The past five years have seen a persistent focus on structures and process at the expense of any real meaningful action. We continue to lag behind in jobs. We have high unemployment and a lack of skills and investment in infrastructure. We simply cannot afford to waste the next five years dithering on structures.It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) particularly since he referred to the most left-wing Opposition the country has seen for years. I am afraid that my remarks may not have as much credibility in that regard as he hopes. The one thing his speech has confirmed is that the subject under discussion is a Conservative pre-election Budget. When he made his tentative references to the northern powerhouse even the sun hid behind the moon and we know that when it re-emerges the Liberal Democrats will take the credit for it and say that that is what they achieved for us by working with others.The Chancellor made it very clear&#8212;although he did not emphasise the point&#8212;that he is raising money in this year&#8217;s Budget and he is doing the same again next year. The substantial spending comes in 2018-19 and beyond&#8212;in the future. It is unreasonable to criticise a man for being lucky but the Chancellor has enjoyed good fortune: inflation is falling; the oil price is coming down&#8212;no doubt the Liberal Democrats want to take credit for that as well but such things are largely outside the control of individual Governments&#8212;and he is the beneficiary of the one-off receipts of the Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages and the Lloyds bank share sell-off.The Chancellor&#8217;s strategy however relies on achieving a further &#163;25 billion-worth of public expenditure cuts. In fairness to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government he has made the point that he cannot do the same thing over again in his Department. Three Departments have a measure of protection: Education Health and International Development leaving the burden to fall on the rest. Given the significance of what is proposed we should have more detail before us. We know that at least &#163;12 billion is to come out of the Department for Work and Pensions budget&#8212;and almost certainly out of the working-age component of the budget. Since much of this is demand-led that seems to me to be quite a difficult thing to do and the Chancellor should have set out to the House exactly how he intends to do it.In his 2014 conference speech the Chancellor pledged a freeze in working-age benefits up to 2017 saving &#163;3 billion. There is more to be found. He has indicatedchanges to jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and housing benefit and in that context the words &#8220;change&#8221; and &#8220;reform&#8221; must mean &#8220;less&#8221;. It is worth reflecting on what other proposals there might be as part of the &#163;12 billion in working age benefit cuts. For example there is the restriction of child benefit to the first two children. Of course the devil is in the detail. If that turns out to be unachievable the alternative&#8212;if the Government are to have a chance to stick to their long-term plan&#8212;will be to look at indirect taxation or at the budgets of the three exempted Departments such as Health.The Conservatives have form on indirect taxation. Before the 1979 election they specifically denied they would double VAT. I remind the House however that they moved it from 8% to 15%&#8212;thus did they keep their pledge. Towards the end of John Major&#8217;s Government the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) abolished zero-rating for fuel bills bringing them permanently into the lower VAT band. Before the last general election the Conservatives had no plans to raise VAT but managed to come up with some immediately after the election.In earlier decades Conservative Chancellors would treat us to a Budget-day lecture on the money supply without mentioning quantitative easing or the over-optimistic use of leverage in the financial services sector including the unregulated shadow banking sector. The Chancellor did not mention these things earlier either. We as a House&#8212;this ought not to be a party political point&#8212;need to focus on the work of the Governor of the Bank of England as regulator of the financial services sector and on the Governor&#8217;s work in foreseeing potential future shocks to the financial system.The Chancellor did make one reference to this in the Budget speech wedged between a section on inflation and a section on farmers&#8217; tax returns. He confirmed the remits of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Financial Policy Committee. There is no new architecture between those committees and the House of Commons but I think there should be. Accountability and transparency would be powerful weapons in ensuring that those serious issues are being taken seriously. The Chancellor made much of the employment figures although the tightening of the labour market is not evenly spread throughout the United Kingdom. Unemployment is still an issue for the north-east of England.I would like to have had some analysis from the Government Front Benchers about the mismatch between the employment figures and the productivity outcomes. The Office for Budget Responsibility described the UK&#8217;s &#8220;productivity puzzle&#8221; as the biggest risk to the United Kingdom&#8217;s economic health. The Chancellor is banking on increased tax revenues to help fulfil his Budget forecasts. Low productivity is holding down pay rises and we are in the fifth year of public sector pay restraint. So there seems to be a contradiction unless there is an as yet unspoken plan to increase indirect taxation. No doubt if the Conservatives win and plough on with their long-term plan they will think about that after the general election.Unemployment remains an issue for the north-east of England. I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s new-found interest in regional policy but we in the north-east are not his northern powerhouse&#8212;that is Manchester and Leeds; we are his northern outhouse. It is not as if the Chancellor is averse to talking about far-away places in his Budgetspeeches&#8212;last year it was Mars; this year it was Agincourt so perhaps next year it could be Tyne and Wear and Teesside.I really would welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s taking an interest in the north-east of England. The tragedy is that the political parties do not really disagree about what we need to do. We need to grow strengthen and deepen the private sector base of the region&#8217;s economy.My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The abolition of the development agency was the largest single blow dealt to economic development in the north-east of England. The Government did it quickly. Governments make most of their mistakes in their first six months. Certainly on economic development in the north-east of England this Government did make most of their mistakes in their first six months.As I said the tragedy is that we do not disagree about what needs to be done. Resources need to be focused and the work needs to be led in an authoritative clear-sighted way. The coalition&#8217;s structural changes do not deliver for the north-east of England. Abolishing the RDA was a big step backwards and the local enterprise partnership is not working for us&#8212;it has not even had a chief executive for the past year. If the North East local enterprise partnership had achieved anything surely the Secretary of State would have told us about it but he did not have anything to say about it. When I intervened to give him a chance to tell us about it he still did not have anything to say apart from generalisations. The money spent over the past five years on regional economic development in the north-east is less than it was for one year under the previous Labour Government&#8217;s arrangements.There is a further regional danger: the unprotected budgets that are lined up for public expenditure cuts disproportionately hit local councils in the north-east. Separately there have been at least two attempts to redistribute within the budgets that the Chancellor has protected. There are proposals to take &#163;230 million out of the north-east&#8217;s health budget and redistribute the money to wealthier parts of the country.The Chancellor said that we are all in it together. However on the cost of living job opportunities local government budgets and a workable economic development strategy it does not feel that way in the north-east of England.It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mrs Riordan. It is also a pleasure to take part in this important debate. I congratulate my neighbour my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) on securing it. It is enormously important to the people we represent that we debate these issues and tease out things that are just not acceptable.At the heart of the problem is the mismatch between the pressure on DWP staff and what is actually obtainable for the citizens we represent in the circumstances of the north-east of England. The inflexibility of the regime&#8212;especially the ESA regime&#8212;is at the heart of many of the individual cases that have been raised so far and of the one or two constituency cases I will raise in a minute.The restricted nature of the jobseekers labour market as opposed to the broader north-east labour market is a significant factor in this as is the Department&#8217;s practice of churning people through projects a further period of JSA and then more projects and of migrating them from incapacity benefit to the new ESA when their chances of actually securing sustainable employment are not that strong.People come to my surgeries as they do to all Members&#8217; surgeries but when their opening gambit is &#8220;You are my last hope&#8221; my heart sinks because I know the system isfailing them and that they have been referred to me as their Member of Parliament by others who are trying to help them or that they feel they have nowhere else to go.One chap I met&#8212;I will call him Mr A because I do not want to put his name into the public domain&#8212;is 62 years old. He has been a labourer all his life. One look at him told me that his days of being a labourer were over. He is on ESA. He is certainly not capable of manual work any more but he is to be churned through a range of schemes to train him for jobs that I do not think he will ever be able to do. I went to visit Ingeus and I do not take as harsh a view of the Work programme as my colleagues. I thought that much of what Ingeus was doing as one of the Government&#8217;s contractors was sensible and well founded; but I was struck by how different the labour market that it was dealing with was from the broader labour market in the north-east of England. The spectrum of all the jobs across the north-east of England is not there for people on ESA. A much narrower range of overwhelmingly service-sector jobs is open to them. I do not think that it will work for the chap who came to see me.The same will be true for another constituent who was referred to me by the Newcastle Society for Blind People which was trying to help her. She is 60 years old and epileptic. Her eyeballs were removed in childhood so she is absolutely blind. She has a carer; he cares for her but cannot read or write. She has been transferred from incapacity benefit to ESA; therefore the system will find her a job. She cannot write or see but can read Braille. She uses a thumbprint for her signature. I have asked the DWP to write to her in Braille. After a lot of haggling between the Department and me it has agreed to note my request. Perhaps I may gently put it to the Minister that there are a number of ways for MPs to deal with issues of this kind: the first might be for me to ask her politely to get the Department to do a bit more than just note my request.Given my constituent&#8217;s age and circumstances and the obvious hardship that she has endured throughout her life it is not fair to her to kid her on that somehow she will now find a job she can do without overcoming every one of the hardships that confront her. It seems just wrong&#8212;almost inhuman&#8212;to put her through the sort of exercises that the Department is putting her through. It is harsh and unreasonable. I once did the Minister&#8217;s job. I was the first Minister for Work when the Department was created under the previous Labour Government. In my time as a Minister I did not come up against a case of this kind referred to me by a Member of Parliament from either side of the House. Had I done so I would have intervened straight away to help the victim of what I would regard as oppressive treatment.Another constituent of mine a 62-year-old was sanctioned for a year for not complying with JSA. As his sanction&#8212;it actually went on for a year and a month&#8212;came to an end he was told that he would be sanctioned for another 13 weeks but not given a reason. He was then told that he had to fill in a JSA10 form at a jobcentre. He went there and was told that the form did not exist any more and that he had to ring the benefit delivery centre. The centre staff told him that he had to go to Felling to fill in a declaration and he walked from Newcastle to Felling. Hon. Members might ask why hewalked when we have some very good integrated transport arrangements in Tyne and Wear. The walk is not a direct one because there is a river in the way and it means going to the centre of Newcastle&#8212;in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central&#8212;over the bridge and along the south bank. My constituent walked because he does not have any money to pay for his travel.When he got to Felling the official gave him a telephone number that he had to ring. It would have been possible either to give him that without requiring him to undertake the journey or to ensure that he had the money to make the journey on public transport rather than having to walk. My constituent then got another phone call from the Department&#8212;which was being proactive for once&#8212;telling him that he faced further sanctions because he had missed an appointment with his work provider. He had not missed any actual work the House will understand &#8212;just a meeting with the provider. He missed the appointment because as he had informed the Department his residency at the Salvation Army on City road was closing down and his mail was not being satisfactorily redirected. That is an issue that will apply to other people who have lived in that facility which was quite well known on Tyneside. He spent 45 minutes on the telephone begging for a hardship payment because he had no money at all to live on. He eventually got an &#163;86-per-fortnight payment&#8212;just think of living on &#163;86 a fortnight&#8212;and was then told that he stood to be sanctioned again and that his national insurance contributions would be withheld as well.My office intervened. MPs always get the credit for dealing with these cases and it is actually our staff who do it. This is probably an appropriate time to thank our staff who work very hard not least on wading through pretty intransigent responses from the Minister&#8217;s Department. It is certainly not how we originally envisaged Jobcentre Plus operating when it was rolled out more than a decade ago. My assistant&#8217;s intervention meant that the matter was finally resolved in a satisfactory way; but we should not be putting people through such turmoil. The system should be on their side. It is meant to be run by the state for the citizens of the country&#8212;and it just is not. It should not be necessary for us to have to take such matters up with the Minister directly. I hope that she will take from the debate the fact that things are going wrong with case work and that there is a need to intervene directly to turn around the culture in the Department that allows that to happen."},
    {"label":"Sadiq Khan","value":"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Ruislip Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd) who for the most part made a very compelling speech. I rise to speak in an absolutely crucial debate for many Londoners. I commend the speeches from my right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) on the Opposition Front Bench and from my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee.There is a housing crisis in London with a growing shortage of affordable homes to buy and rent. Precious public services are struggling to attract and retain workers and the city&#8217;s businesses cite housing as their single biggest concern. Many Londoners are in distress over housing due to their inability to make any progress on a council housing waiting list or because of poor quality accommodation.One of the biggest issues is the rising cost of housing to rent and buy and for many Londoners buying their own home is simply a pipe dream. The average deposit to buy a place&#8212;not the purchase price&#8212;is now &#163;100000. That is three times the median salary of someone in inner London and four times the salary of someone in outer London. As a result more and more Londoners have no choice but to rent yet rents in London have now reached an all-time high of &#163;1300. Rents are rising year on year and have risen by 38% since 2010. Housing benefit spend&#8212;essentially the taxpayer making up the shortfall between what Londoners can afford to pay and what the market is charging&#8212;increased in London from &#163;5.3 billion in 2010 to &#163;6.1 billion now. Add to that the Government&#8217;s welfare changes the bedroom tax cuts to tax credits and the lowering of the welfare cap and that pretty toxic combination is hollowing out many inner-London boroughs. That is putting enormous strain on the social fabric of London and increasing pressure on housing transport and public services in many of London&#8217;s outer suburbs.The Conservative leader of Westminster Council was speaking on behalf of Londoners who care about London&#8217;s social fabric and are worried about the hollowing out of our city&#8212;I wish that more Conservative Members would take up that debate. With the Bill the Government have a real opportunity to start the process of solving this crisis but they have flunked it. Instead of solutions their proposals will make the problems even worse.Let me turn to the extension of the right to buy to housing association tenants. Over recent years there has been no like-for-like replacement of affordable homes sold under the existing right-to-buy scheme. The Secretary of State could not dispute figures from his own Department that I put to him which show that in London since 2012 only one in seven council homes sold have been replaced. How can anyone believe that it will be different this time? There is nothing in the Bill to guarantee that money must be reinvested in the local area replacing like-for-like sold-off homes.Some housing associations are relaxed about selling off homes in inner London and replacing them with units in cheaper parts of outer London or even further afield. That damages London&#8217;s social mix accelerating the exodus of poorer people out of our great city and making the affordability crisis even worse. To make matters worse the only way that the Government could fund this policy is by forcing councils to sell off the most expensive homes. In London that means losing substantial amounts of affordable family homes and the city&#8217;s low and middle-income families will be squeezed out to fund the sell-off of housing association homes nationwide.Together with colleagues from across the House who want to join me I will be fighting to retain the money from housing association and council property sales in London for Londoners. There must also be provision for like-for-like replacements in the same areas as where the properties are soldIt is not as if the Government are planning a big boost in truly affordable homes. They have put all their eggs in the starter home basket but in London starter homes simply will not help struggling first-time buyers. With starter homes capped at a cost of &#163;4500 someone with a 25% deposit&#8212;that by the way is &#163;98000&#8212;would need an income of &#163;77000 to afford one. The Secretary of State talks about aspiration but who exactly is he talking about?This Bill is a missed opportunity. It will not fix London&#8217;s housing crisis; in fact it will make it worse. It will not deliver the genuinely affordable homes Londoners need to buy or rent. It will not help the councils and the Mayor to start to build the homes Londoners desperately need. It will not rein in spiralling rent rises for those in the private sector. It will not end the scandal of the homelessness problem.Next May&#8217;s mayoral election is a referendum on the capital&#8217;s housing crisis. This Bill reinforces why that referendum cannot come soon enough.Thank you Sir Edward. You have clearly heard me speak before.I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) who said how well known and iconic the black cab is around the world. Famously at the closing ceremony of the Olympics there was much comment about George Michael&#8217;s bad choice of song but Ray Davies of The Kinks made the right choice when he entered the stadium in a black cab. Ray Davies got it right and George Michael got it wrong.The hon. Gentleman was right to comment on the positive things about black cabs. They are fully accessible to wheelchair users providing a service to disabled passengers who may have few other ways of getting about. As the father of two daughters I also fully understand his comment about how safe we feel putting our children in a black cab knowing the checks that take place before someone is allowed to drive one.It is worth reminding ourselves of why black cab drivers&#8212;particularly the London ones&#8212;are considered some of the most qualified in the world. They undergo extensive criminal checks including by the Disclosure and Barring Service. Medical checks are also undertaken. People have to pass a Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency assessment. They also have to receive a licence from both TfL which is run by the Mayor of London and the Metropolitan Police Service. In addition as the hon. Gentleman mentioned they have to pass the knowledge. Hon. Members may not fully appreciate this but the test requires drivers to learn more than 300 basic routes more than 25000 streets and approximately 20000 landmarks and places of public interest. The other requirement is that black cab drivers must have a high-standard vehicle.It is also worth reminding ourselves of what has happened as a consequence of the failure to regulate the change that is taking place because of innovation and of the failure to adapt. We do not have a level playing field and the Minister will need to tell us why over the past five years&#8212;indeed the past seven years&#8212;TfL and the Government have failed to enforce existing legislation or to provide new regulations to ensure that new entrants to the market operate fairly.What is the consequence of the failure of TfL and the Government to act? The number of drivers licensed by TfL fell by more than 500 in the last year alone to about 25000. Worse the number of people applying to be taxi drivers and to undertake the knowledge is the lowest in more than 20 years. When we speak to black cab drivers they confirm that their income has dropped by about 20% during the day and by about 35% during the night shift.At the same time the number of private hire vehicles licensed by TfL has grown at the rate of 600 a week. As the hon. Gentleman said there are now 86500. He also mentioned that there has been a 46.1% increase since 2010. At those levels the number of private hire vehicles in London will reach more than 105000 over the nexttwo years. As my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) said that not only leads to problems with congestion pollution and illegal parking but will lead to the death of the black cab as we know it.My hon. Friend is right. I made that point earlier in an intervention. We have had innovation in technology but what my hon. Friend has described requires innovation in regulation. I do not mean a race to the bottom; I think that a levelling up rather than levelling down is required.Does the Minister agree with criticisms of TfL that it failed to carry out proper licensing and enforcement functions in relation to the hire market? Does he agree with the hon. Member for Richmond Park and me that the Government should introduce legislation containing a clear definition to protect the distinction between taxis and private hire vehicles? Is he aware of the concerns raised by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association that TfL may wrongly have licensed Uber in 2012 not fully understanding its methods of operation and that it now has concerns about revocation for fear of paying compensation? If the Minister thinks new legislation isrequired will he consider whether it should include limits on the number of private hire vehicles in London for the reasons that the hon. Member for Richmond Park and I have given to do with congestion pollution and illegal parking? Does he agree that any legislation should as my right hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) mentioned require any licensed operators to have a UK tax liability? Also&#8212;and this is probably the most important issue for black cab drivers&#8212;would the new legislation define plying for hire?What reforms is the Department for Transport considering to secure a fairer system for London&#8217;s cabbies and a better service for passengers&#8212;an important consideration at the core of this issue? Would that include a clear distinction between the working practices for black cabs and private hire vehicles? Finally we understand the temptation for Ministers to meet celebrities and for the Mayor of London to meet Joanna Lumley; but roughly how many times have the Minister other Transport Ministers or the Mayor had meetings with the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association or black cab drivers&#8217; representatives such as Unite GMB and the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers?The hon. Member for Richmond Park deserves our thanks for bringing this debate to Westminster Hall. He has raised important issues as I hope I have and it is important that the Minister and the current Mayor respond. If they do not the next Mayor will.There are 14 Labour MPs wanting to speak in the debate so it is disappointing that two Tory Back Benchers spent 25 minutes this morning filibustering on an issue that is important to many of us.There is a housing crisis. Not enough homes are being built and those that are being built are not of the right sort. There are not enough homes with a genuinely affordable rent&#8212;a social rent linked to earnings rather than market value. There are not enough homes being built for which people can pay a London living rent. There are not enough family homes being built and there are too many being sold off-plan to people in Singapore Hong Kong and Malaysia. I have nothing against those countries and the people who live there but we cannot allow our homes to be used as gold bricks by foreign investors and to sit empty.It is a con when people talk about the market value of properties. The Mayor has a definition of 80% of market value as affordable. The Valuation Agency&#8217;s private rental market statistics show that the market rent for a four-bedroom private property is &#163;2500; for a three-bedroom property it is &#163;1695; for a two-bedroom property it is &#163;1400; and for a one-bedroom property it is &#163;1155. We can see why there is a housing crisis in London which some people do not want us to talk about in Parliament.My hon. Friend is right and that is why there is a crisis. In the King&#8217;s Cross scheme which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) will know about one-bedroom properties are selling at &#163;985000. The price for a two-bedroom property there is &#163;1.7 million. In Heygate in Elephant Park a studio flat will cost &#163;569000 and a two-bedroom property will cost &#163;800000. It is possible to get a penthouse at a discount at &#163;2.1 million. We now have a city where developments have &#8220;poor doors&#8221;. There is a door for people who can afford market value and there are poor doors for those who cannot.Freedom of information tribunals have shown that developers in Heygate the Greenwich peninsula and Earls Court have taken advantage of the viability con which means that they can say it is not viable to build affordable homes. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North talked about Islington which now has a new scheme that will be open and transparent. Developers will have to publish their viability assessments for schemes. I do not care whether we use the term &#8220;rent control&#8221; &#8220;rent cap&#8221; or &#8220;rent stabilisation&#8221;. We need to sort out the rental market in London. More than half the disposable income of those who rent&#8212;a quarter of Londoners&#8212;goes on rent. That is unacceptable and is a reason why last year more than 60000 Londoners aged between 30 and 39 left London. We have a brain drain from London caused by the housing crisis.To compound that we have&#8212;even in the words of the two filibustering Tory Members who spoke in the debate&#8212; a housing supply crisis in London. What is their answer? It is to sell off housing association properties and force councils to sell off their most expensive properties. That will lead to a situation in which good councils such as Islington and Camden must sell the new properties that they have built. Social cleansing is taking place in London; we are copying Paris and New York for the wrong reasons.If the Government are going to force councils and housing associations to sell properties all that we need is that they should require them to build one before they sell one like for like in the same area unless there are exceptional reasons not to. Then London will not become a city for the rich only with outer London for those who cannot afford to live in inner London. Conservative Members who have spoken may think that a modern London of that kind is acceptable but those of us who have made the effort to come to this 9.30 am debate but did not get the chance to speak because of the disgraceful filibustering want change."},
    {"label":"Chi Onwurah","value":"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Gray. I congratulate the hon. Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) on securing this debate. The number of Members here and the good-natured tone of the debate are a tribute to his work and that of the all-party group and I hope not to undermine that tone too much. Let me start by declaring a personal interest in outdoor recreation. Growing up in a city with the glorious town moor at its heart in what is undoubtedly the most beautiful county&#8212;Northumberland&#8212;with the most stunning coasts and the glorious Cheviot hills how could I not have that interest?Despite the beauty of our countryside which several Members emphasised we have an inactivity crisis in the UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) gave many examples of the cost and consequences of the crisis. Together with the hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) he highlighted some of the many mental and physical benefits that come from activity. It can reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and address moderate mental depression and anxiety. That helps to reduce pressure on the NHS and helps people to live longer independent and healthier lives as well as reducing the cost of days lost to the economy. In addition physical activity can improve academic performance and educational attainment as the hon. Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan) illustrated and that can help to tackle youth unemployment. We cannot overestimate the benefits that come from the great outdoors and we must not lose this opportunity to consider the social and economic benefits that come from sport.We should also remember the many major tournaments and sporting events that we have hosted in the UK. The rugby world cup which reaches its climax this weekend has been a huge triumph for the organisers. It is predicted to generate up to &#163;2.2 billion of output into the economy and has supported 41000 jobs across the country. Sadly it has not been such a resounding success for the home nations on the pitch but&#8212;moving quickly on&#8212;the benefits of the 2012 Olympic games continue to flow with the visitors to the UK and the businesses attracted to locate and trade here. More recently the Yorkshire Grand D&#233;part of the Tour de France provided a &#163;128 million boost to Yorkshire Cambridgeshire Essex and London. I hope that a Grand D&#233;part in Northumberland will one day provide a similar boost there. All those events help to inspire people to take part in pursuits as well as generating economic activity.Outdoor recreation is the UK&#8217;s favourite pastime. Along with tourism it is a key economic driver particularly in rural areas as emphasised by the hon. Members for Wells (James Heappey) for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) and for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Liz Saville Roberts). Just this weekend I set out on a red ramble with 23 of my Newcastle Labour comrades around Ovington in the Tyne valley and afterwards we contributed something to the local economy in the local pub.Whether it is walking mountaineering angling canoeing off-road cycling horse riding or any of the other outdoor pursuits we have discussed this afternoon we need to ensure that more people take advantage of the opportunities afforded to us. The hon. Members for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) and for Weaver Vale (Graham Evans) emphasised that point. Expenditure in the sector supports landowners such as the National Trust retailers and manufacturers outdoor clothing and equipment shops and outdoor centres. It supports many in different sectors and brings economy activity to areas where it is much needed.It is essential that the Government deliver a strong coherent and joined-up sport and physical activity strategy which is what the Labour party and those working in the sector have been calling for. According to the most recent data from Sport England there are around 400000 fewer people taking part in sport once a week than there were in 2011-12 including 275700 fewer women. That is of particular concern. Also the percentage of those in the lowest income groups who participate has fallen from 29.3% to 25.7%. Those figures are an indictment of the Government&#8217;s approach to sport from removal of ring-fenced funding for school sports two years prior to the games to the decision to water down protections for playing fields.I encourage the Minister to look at Labour&#8217;s &#8220;More Sport for All&#8221; policy document. I am encouraged by the Government&#8217;s recent consultation on sport and I hope it signals a change in intent that the Minister will elaborate on. I hope she will take this opportunity to confirm a timeline for implementing a new sports strategy and let us know what commitments she has received from colleagues in other Departments to deliver a joined-up sports strategy going forward and I hope she will respond to the many questions raised by hon. Members in this debate. I look forward to her responses to the proposals and to hearing how the Government look to address them in the upcoming sports strategy.As I think I was saying before democracy interrupted me my right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter explained that the BBC&#8217;s decision is not the end for the Met Office&#8212;far from it: it does much more than weather forecasts. However the decision raises questions about the strategic relationship of the BBC and the weather forecaster. Has the Minister discussed that with the BBC and does he have concerns about it?I am intrigued by the timing of the decision. Is it right to award a 10-year contract when the charter renewal process is about to decide on the entire future of the BBC and its purpose? Should not such important decisions be made after we know the outcome of the process? I understand that the contract does not expire until next year. Is it too late to review the decision and the process? Will there be increased transparency about the criteria for the decision that has been made?What if as part of the open consultation the Minister is running with the British public we decide that the purpose of the BBC is indeed to provide integrated weather warnings at critical times? In its briefings to Members the BBC has said that the decision to go to open tender was a legal one&#8212;something that it had to do. I support open tendering of course. We need competitive procurement to prevent contracts from being handed out to the same old cronies and to enable new and innovative companies to have access to the &#163;242 billion of public procurement cash available from the public sector but what discussions have the Government had with the BBC regarding other aspects of the contract such as social value?I am sure the Minister is aware that recent European Union law exempts some services from procurement laws and other laws allow organisations to make allowances in certain circumstances&#8212;for instance where there is a question of social value. The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 came into force in February and expand on exemptions for co-operation between entities in the public sector which I would have thought was exactly the case here. What is the Minister&#8217;s interpretation of that exemption? Has he taken any advice on the rules in this case? If so can he share it with the House today or deposit it in the Library or ideally both?One charge often levelled by Members of this House and others is that we are too strict on ourselves in this country when interpreting and obeying EU laws and can err on the side of extreme caution so will the Minister bring his considerable resources to bear and see whether this 93-year-old relationship does not have to be sacrificed? We have yet to decide what the BBC is for or what outcomes we want. The BBC is a great British institution. It is public sector it is successful and it is loved. Of course it needs to evolve with the times and with technology but it also needs the support and championing of this Government.I could say exactly the same about the Met Office. My right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter and the hon. Member for Torbay described in detail how successful and appreciated the Met Office is and it too needs to evolve with the times and with technology. The Met Office also deserves the support and championing of this Government. I will listen with interest to the Minister as always but it seems strange that these two great British institutions should not be natural allies and partners.And as a previous Secretary of State. He knows his subject comprehensively. I am sure that the Minister will extend my right hon. Friend the courtesy of answering all his questions as fully as possible.As my right hon. Friend said in his introduction the Met Office is a respected and successful institution. He touched briefly on the origins of what is now known as the Met Office. Those origins reflect many supremely British characteristics: naval power trade exploration science and eccentricity. The Met Office was first founded as the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade by Robert FitzRoy who is most famous for being the captain of HMS Beagle the ship that carried Charles Darwin on his famous voyage. More than 160 years ago this House roared with laughter when a Member suggested that we might one day predict the weather in advance. FitzRoy led an interesting and troubled life but pressed on in the face of scepticism about weather reporting. Today his vision of a public forecasting service funded by the Government for the benefit of all has endured.The modern Met Office is respected the world over and has an important place at the heart of the nation&#8217;s contingency planning and our culture. Indeed the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (John Nicolson) emphasised its role in the heart of Scotland&#8217;s culture. We all like to poke fun at weather forecasters for getting it wrong but the fact is that the Met Office is critical to our military security and civil planning. Its shipping forecasts make the jobs of those at sea a little safer as the hon. Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster) rightly emphasised. Its global research links enhance our understanding of how the weather and climate affect our economy and way of life and its parliamentary advice makes us all&#8212;at least those of us who make use of it&#8212;a little wiser.I hope the Minister will assure us that the Met Office is not on the Government&#8217;s list of public sector targets. In fact I hope that he and his colleagues will go further and champion its work and the unique role it plays. Perhaps they might even recognise the value that such public sector institutions play in our society and economy. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter said this decision is not the end of the Met Office&#8212;far from it. It does so much more than providing the BBC with weather forecasts. In fact its data will still drive those forecasts. The decision raises questions about the strategic relationship between the BBC and the weather provider. The police and the military will continue to rely on the Met Office for advice while the public may receive different information. My right hon. Friend cited international examples that raise serious questions about this approach. Is the Minister concerned about that and has he discussed it with the BBC?Many in the Conservative party believe that the BBC needs to be clipped either because of misplaced ideas that it crowds out competitors or because of perceived bias. I find it difficult to divorce this decision and this debate from the wider context of the charter renewal process and the sustained attack that the BBC is coming under from the Government and their friends. The BBC is under immense pressure at the moment to prove to the Government and the wider public that it is efficient and good value for money. Obviously we are all in favour of value for money but what matters is how we define value and over what period of time. Even if we accept that there is no risk to the national interest&#8212;which I have yet to be convinced of although I will listen closely to the Minister&#8212;I am not persuaded that the cheapest option is always the best.Sitting suspended for Divisions in the House.Onresuming&#8212;Thank you Mr Speaker for granting this urgent question.When someone&#8217;s data are lost criminals are given a gateway into their lives. I have spoken to one woman who lost &#163;5000 in a sophisticated scam following a previous TalkTalk breach. Today up to 4 million people are wondering what data they have lost and where a cyber-attack will come from. They are checking their bank accounts callers and credit cards. The Government need to reassure us that our digital lives are secure and they need to help our digital economy to grow.When did the Minister first speak to TalkTalk about the breach and its implications? Is he now aware of what data were taken and whether they were encrypted? What obligations were there on TalkTalk to report the breach to the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office and to advise customers and did it do that quickly enough? What rights of compensation do TalkTalk customers have and for how long and how can they exercise them?Will the Minister ask the Information Commissioner to update his guidance in the light of the current confusion? What additional resources will police have to respond to the up to 4 million inquiries from frightened customers and will the breach be reported as one cybercrime or many?For many years we have been calling on the Government to take action to protect consumers and citizens from cyber-scams. This Government&#8217;s data policy is chaos illuminated by occasional flashes of incompetence. Will the Minister acknowledge that all the innovation has come from the criminals while the Government sit on their hands leaving it to businesses and consumers to suffer the consequences?It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Chope. I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) on securing this important debate. I also congratulate hon. Members on both sides on their contributions.As has been said media plurality is at the heart of any healthy democracy. The United Kingdom is a vibrant diverse complex and at times eccentric country. It is essential that our broadcasting reflect that. It is also important that we have not only a diverse creative sector but a plurality of current affairs sources.Wales is an important lively and diverse nation within the United Kingdom and it has its own distinctive language and culture. I cannot claim to have any Welsh connections but it is often remarked that there are similarities between the north-east where I am from and Wales in terms of people&#8217;s warmth eloquence and attractive accent and unfortunately in terms of the decline in some of their more classic industries.It is critical that Wales should have a plurality of broadcasters that not only encourages different viewpoints but ensures that Welsh people are informed of matters that are important to them. Having a critical mass of media production also stimulates the creative industries which create jobs.It has been clear for some time that UK media coverage of Welsh affairs is poor to put it mildly. Representing a constituency 290 miles from London I have first-hand knowledge of how insular a national media based almost entirely in London can be. Indeed I have held debates in this room about the effect that that has on the diversity or lack of it in the national media. It was indeed in July that the contribution by the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams) helped to familiarise me with the unique situation in Wales and some of the challenges there.In the north-east there is a strong regional news presence to fill that gap. I am grateful to our locally based Journal and Chronical as well as to the Made in Tyne &amp; Wear channel and indeed to BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Look North&#8221; and to &#8220;Tyne Tees&#8221; news which have a local base even though they are not locally headquartered.It is important to remember that non-devolved services are covered in the UK news and they are relevant to my constituents but much less so to Welsh ones. It is clear from speeches made on both sides of the Chamber that the market for current affairs in Wales is failing to provide adequate services for the Welsh people. BBC Wales covers the National Assembly as we have heard but it is essential that people should be afforded a choice of current affairs programming and coverage. Coverage is being reduced and the problems that traditional media organisations across the UK experience are exacerbated for Welsh content providers.My hon. Friend intervened just as I was going to mention her in another context. She is quite right that a local radio network particularly a BBC one is an important part of media plurality providing a local or regional insight and perspective on the news. I do not know where we would be without local coverage of our great sporting events for example. I was grateful to her for making the point that large parts of north-east Wales cannot in any case receive BBC Wales so its impact is limited and that encourages many Welsh citizens to turn to the national UK media outlets.The fact that many Welsh people choose to consume UK media may also be a symptom of the convergence of media outlets. We cannot and do not want to stop the rise of digital and new media and the innovation that that brings. However as Ofcom&#8217;s Welsh advisory committee has noted:&#8220;None of the London-based newspaper titles publishes a Welsh edition and there is almost a total absence of Welsh content in UK-wide newspapers.&#8221;Historically as we have heard north and south Wales have different papers and many Welsh people if not the majority take UK papers. While technology is disrupting traditional media models and creating many innovative online communities and interest groups&#8212;we have heard some of the hopes for the future in that regard&#8212;it has yet to provide a model that pays for local journalists on the ground covering events in communities and council chambers or even the National Assembly Chamber. I speak as a champion of the internet when I say that we must recognise that the internet is not yet an alternative to independent professional journalism&#8212;certainly not yet in Wales. Ofcom&#8217;s advisory committee on Wales reported what many people have known for some time: that the situation is a cause for considerable concern and is getting worse.Now a double whammy of cuts is coming down the track for public service broadcasters in Wales. The Chancellor&#8217;s decision to make the BBC pay for free TV licences for those over 75 has resulted in cuts to services. The Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport confirmed that Welsh programming would not be spared.As to the direct funding&#8212;I do not believe it is a subsidy&#8212;from DCMS for Welsh output it has been reported in the media although of course we do not know that DCMS is planning for 40% cuts to its budget. In those circumstances it is highly likely that there are further cuts in the pipeline for Welsh output; but of course it is for the Minister to give us certainty about that.The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. I agree that there should have been consultation with S4C but I would also make the observation that the Secretary of State made his decision without consulting anyone and in direct contradiction of criticisms he made while he was the Chair of the Select Committee on Culture Media and Sport. In a democratic country we would expect consultation on a decision as important as funding and obviously that would include consulting S4C on its funding.I want to finish with some questions to the Minister. I am curious about what assessment he has made of the cuts in a situation that is already a cause for serious concern. I have asked DCMS Ministers that question about a number of areas over the years and the answer is all too often a variation on &#8220;not much&#8221;. I hope that a Wales Office Minister can do better. What is the Minister doing to improve and strengthen media plurality in Wales? What discussions has he had with the Welsh Government and DCMS on cuts to Welsh public sector broadcasters? What assessment have the Government made of the effects of cuts on those broadcasters both before and since they were made? What discussions has he had with national media organisations more broadly in the private and public sectors about their coverage in Wales? Does he agree that there is a crisis in Welsh media plurality and can he point to a policy or plan to address it?I am sure that the Minister agrees with me and hon. Members about the importance of the issue to Wales. I am leaving as much time as he could need to set out how he plans to tackle it. The challenge is a long-term one that is not likely to go away without intervention from his Department working in partnership across Government.Well it has been a long time. Before entering Parliament in 2010 I spent 20 years as an electrical engineer building telecoms networks around the world. I confess to having had a geeky worry that my technical knowledge would suffer as part of the privilege of being elected to the House. The Government have been so ineffectual however that my technical understanding remains as relevant as ever. Ministers should be ashamed of that because it is their failure.The UK has the sixth largest economy in the world and is a developed nation with aspirations to lead the digital world. It is a country where Government services are &#8220;digital by default&#8221; yet we have heard from many speakers in all parts of the House about the dire state of our digital infrastructure. I am not going to repeat all the terrible tales that we have heard: 1.8 million homes that cannot get broadband; dial-up speeds; businesses unable to do business. The economic benefits of better digital infrastructure&#8212;or in some cases of any kind of digital infrastructure&#8212;have been emphasised. The UK&#8217;s productivity problem was mentioned and it is one of the biggest challenges that our economy faces. We have the second worst productivity in the G7. Ministers contribute to the problem with a lack of productivity when it comes to providing the digital infrastructure that this country needs. The Government&#8217;s own broadband impact study states:&#8220;It is now widely accepted that the availability and adoption of affordable broadband plays an important role in increasing productivity&#8221;.The Minister laughs but this is serious for many of his MPs. Better infrastructure increases productivity by&#8220;supporting the development of new more efficient business models enabling business process re-engineering to improve the efficiency and management of labour intensive jobs and enabling increased international trade and collaborative innovation&#8221;.Many Members on both sides of the House have given examples of that. As the new Leader of the Opposition and the new shadow Chancellor told conference this year at theheart of our forward-looking narrative will be plans for investing in the future including &#8220;investment in fast broadband to support new high technology jobs&#8221;.It is possible as the last Labour Government demonstrated to have a telecoms network that includes competition if there is a strong regulator and a Government who are committed to ensuring that competition delivers services for consumers. Unfortunately that is no longer the case.The internet provides social benefits as we have heard. Online shopping is often cheaper and the internet opens up access to public and private services. It is not right that some people cannot access Government services for which they pay or even worse that they are penalised for not being able to access them online whether they are farmers or people on benefits trying to sign on and do their job hunting online. The internet opens up a world of free education and is a window on the globe. It is absolutely ludicrous that the Government have not been able to provide what has become the fourth utility.The Government attack the right to strike for working people but they have effectively withdrawn their labour when it comes to superfast broadband. Underneath the polite tone of the motion Members in all parts of the House know that anger is growing among their constituents especially in rural areas. The truth is that it will take more than a summit to reverse a failure by the Government to deliver on their promises which lacked ambition to begin with. When the Labour Government left office they left fully funded plans for basic broadband&#8212;[Interruption];I am sorry it is the truth&#8212;to be delivered in two years and superfast broadband to be delivered to 90% by 2017. The remaining 10% would be covered by mobile broadband.Now we are falling further and further behind our competitors. Australia is aiming for 100 megabits for 93% of premises by 2021 and South Korea will have 1 gigabit by 2017 yet we do not have a target this decade for getting everyone online.Instead we have had five years of ad hoc funding announcements and vanity projects whenever the Chancellor has wanted to sweeten the latest round of punishing austerity&#8212;a series of disconnected policy initiatives that were never very ambitious but that have suffered from delays nevertheless.The crown jewel in all those projects&#8212;the &#163;790-million rural superfast broadband programme&#8212;was handed entirely to one company because of a badly designed monopoly-favouring procurement programme that has been panned by every Committee to have considered it in this House and the other place and criticised by anyone who has taken a passing interest in it. That is the fault not of BT but of Ministers.What we need from the Government is a vision for a market-led future-proof universal digital infrastructure. Ultimately that means fibre going to premises and real investment. It will not come along on its own. Ministers need to set out a vision for our digital infrastructure. They need to tell us how we will get there and ensure that it happens. Instead all we have is complacency and chutzpah. Demand in this debate has outstripped supply as is the case with broadband in the UK. I urge hon. Members to remember the importance of digital skills and digital inclusion as well as digital infrastructure. There are still 5 million households that have no access to the internet and 1 million more who do not feel confident using it.The Government have no coherent strategy. There is a lack of vision and a staggering level of incompetence in implementation. There has been a super-slow crawl-out rather than a roll-out to just 2 million premises so far with constant delays."},
    {"label":"Jane Ellison","value":"We understand the hon. Member is referring to cancer communications.Public Health England (PHE) runs a number of Be Clear on Cancer (BCoC) campaigns to encourage symptom recognition and earlier general practitioner (GP) presentation. The campaigns have been running since early 2011 and have covered a number of cancers nationally and regionally. Incidence increases with age for most cancers and BCoC targets men and women over 50 especially those from lower socioeconomic groups as there is evidence that these individuals are more likely to delay seeing their GP. Although BCoC campaigns target people over 50 they do reach a much wider age group because of national media campaign activity.Specialist organisations are consulted on campaign development to ensure that communications are accessible and inclusive. These have included Mencap the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities and EasyHealth specifically targeting people with learning disabilities and using their networks to share information effectively. In addition campaign materials are produced in alternative formats including easy read. Disability and carer organisations are sent tailored briefing sheets and toolkits to ensure their members are aware of campaign messages and the availability of alternative formats. Following each campaign PHE seeks feedback from the disability and carer organisations it has worked with to evaluate the success of the engagement and ensure improvements are made where possible.Locally there are also a number of good examples where the National Health Service is tailoring its communications to ensure they are accessible to all groups including those with learning disabilities. NHS England is exploring how these can be taken forward and built on at a national level. For example easy read versions of cancer screening leaflets are available for people with learning disabilities.The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises Ministers and the National Health Service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy. The UK NSC reviews its recommendations on a three year basis or earlier if any new peer reviewed evidence emerges.The UK NSC is currently reviewing the evidence on whether human papillomavirus testing as primary screening for cervical disease should replace the currently used cytology test and whether faecal immunochemical testing could be used as the primary screening marker in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Public consultations on both reviews have just closed and the UK NSC is expected to make a recommendation to ministers later this month.The NHS Breast Screening Programme is currently carrying out a long-term trial to investigate extending current screening eligibility to women aged 47-49 and 71-73. Over two million women have taken part in a randomised control trial with the impact on breast cancer mortality rates due to be reported in the early 2020s. The UK NSC will consider the research evidence when it is published.We are not aware of steps being taken by employers to enable staff to take time off work to attend cancer screening appointments. However Macmillan has produced &#8220;Your rights at work&#8221; an information leaflet on reasonable adjustments in the workplace for people who have or have had cancer.In 2011 the UK NSC recommended that bowel scope screening could be offered in addition to the homes testing kit as part of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Currently 76% of bowel scope screening centres in England are operational and the Secretary of State&#8217;s commitment is to have this programme rolled out to all screening centres in England by the end of 2016. Health Education England has commissioned a training pilot for non-medical endoscopists (NMEs) to provide accelerated training in certain diagnostics procedures with the aim of providing additional screening capacity. The pilot will commence in January 2016. A framework has also been developed to help NMEs demonstrate that they have achieved the competency levels required for their role.The NHS Screening Programmes have a dedicated team who oversee education training and stakeholder information. This involves working closely with Royal Colleges Professional bodies stakeholder groups NHS England Health Education England and the Public Health England campaigns team. A vast range of educational resources exist which are free to NHS staff and cover all screening programme plus the theory and practice of screening. The team is currently expanding the range of taught courses and e-learning resources to make learning more accessible. Accessible patient information is available to educate users of the service and enable informed choices regarding screening. This is complemented by a comprehensive set of material on NHS Choices regarding all 11 NHS Screening Programmes. Patient information is constantly updated and users are involved in the reviews and evaluation of all materials.To increase rates of cervical screening in young women the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme has commissioned a &#163;1 million study to determine which interventions are effective at increasing screening uptake amongst women who are receiving their first invitation from the NHS Cervical Screening Programme. The study began in November 2011 and reports can be expected in spring 2016.In addition the Department of Health Behavioural Insight team is developing a trial to investigate the use of behavioural insights to optimise the content of the invitation letter for cervical screening.  It is not possible to identify a count of people within Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets. Instead we have provided a count of finished admission episodes (FAEs)[1] with a primary diagnosis[2] of vascular dementia[3] for the years 2009-10 to 2013-14[4]. This data only includes admissions to hospital. This is likely to be a small subset of those with the condition as there may be other cases of vascular dementia diagnosed in primary care or outpatient settings.YearFAEs2009-1056612010-1155812011-1252362012-1351512013-144505Information on the cost of treating vascular dementia over this period is not available.[1] An FAE is the first period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year or month in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of patients as a person may have more than one admission within the period.[2] The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.[3] The following ICD10 codes was used to identify vascular dementia:F01 - Vascular dementia[4] HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years) improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. Conversely apparent increases in activity may be due to improved recording of diagnosis or procedure information.It should be noted that HES include activity ending in the year in question and run from April to March e.g. 2012-13 includes activity ending between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.One of the independent Cancer Taskforce report&#8217;s six strategic priorities is to &#8220;spearhead a radical upgrade in prevention and public health&#8221;. NHS England is currently working with partners across the health system to determine how best to take forward the recommendations of the report.As part of putting in place a governance structure for delivery of the strategy NHS England has appointed Cally Palmer as NHS National Cancer Director. She will lead the implementation of the strategy as well as new cancer vanguards using outcomes-based commissioning to redesign care and patient experience. Ms Palmer is Chief Executive of the Royal Marsden Hospital.Public Health England (PHE) runs a number of successful campaigns relating to cancer prevention.The tobacco marketing programme runs a range of activity to highlight the health harms of smoking. This includes demonstrating the link between smoking and cancer as well as encouraging smokers to make quit attempts and signposting them to proven NHS tools and services to help. These programmes have been shown to have a positive impact on reducing adult smoking prevalence.PHE&#8217;s flagship social marketing campaign Change4Life aims to help families and children in England to eat well move more and live longer. Some cancers are highlighted as a health consequence within the campaign messaging. The campaign has enjoyed considerable success and unparalleled levels of engagement. Since its launch in 2009 more than 2.7 million people have signed up to Change4Life and it now has more than 200 national partners. Its tools and resources incentivise and encourage behaviour change.These complement the Be Clear on Cancer campaigns (BCoC) that encourage symptom recognition and earlier general practitioner presentation. BCoC campaigns have been running since early 2011 and have covered a number of cancers nationally and regionally.Government set up the independent Lead Ammunition Group in 2010 to provide advice on risks to wildlife and human health from lead shot game. The Government is considering the independent Lead Ammunition Group&#8217;s report on the effect of lead shot on human and wildlife health and will respond as soon as possible The Food Standards Agency (FSA) accepts the expert advice of the UK Committee on Toxicity and the European Food Safety Authority that it is not possible to set a safe level for exposure to lead from food. However to better understand the potential risk to UK consumers the FSA produced a risk assessment in 2012 based on its survey data from 2007 of game meat samples; Veterinary Medicines Directorate data from the national surveillance scheme was also considered. The FSA risk assessment considered the potential levels of exposure to lead from lead shot game for adults children and toddlers based on different levels of game meat consumption.This risk assessment led to FSA issuing targeted advice to frequent consumers of lead shot game in 2012 warning of the potential risks. The advice was promoted as especially important for vulnerable groups such as toddlers and children pregnant women and women trying for a baby as exposure to lead can harm the developing brain and nervous system. The FSA risk assessment was published along with this advice. The Government has not estimated the number of people who regularly consume game meat shot with lead.More generally the FSA works on behalf of the UK within the European Union to agree harmonised controls to reduce public exposure to lead in the food chain. EU maximum limits apply for lead in a range of foods and these are regularly reviewed by the EU Commission and member states. These maximum limits apply to all food produced in the EU or imported to the EU.Immunisation to protect those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza this winter commenced in September 2015. The first comprehensive monthly report on vaccine uptake and numbers of people vaccinated showing the position at the end of October is due to be published on 26 November at:https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/vaccine-uptake#seasonal-flu-vaccine-uptake-figuresSome provisional weekly uptake data reported from about half of participating general practitioners (GP) practices in England are available. From this we estimate the total number of patients who have been vaccinated so far this season up to 8 November in those aged six months to under 65 years with a clinical condition and those aged 65 and over is about 8.9 million in England.Further breakdown on vaccinations given by health-care setting such as in pharmacy schools or in other settings is being collected for the first time this season through this GP based surveillance system. It is hoped that this information will be published at the end of season in 2016.The above information does not include influenza vaccinations provided outside the national influenza immunisation programme for example to healthy adults. It is not possible to predict how many people will be vaccinated against influenza this winter.Information on the number of influenza vaccinations administered by private providers is not collected centrally. The national influenza immunisation programme is designed to protect those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza. The largest proportion of vaccinations is administered at general practices with pharmacies and schools also playing an important role.Immunisation against influenza is also available privately to those not recommended for vaccination under the National Health Service programme. Immunisation typically takes place at retail pharmacies and is solely delivered by private providers. NHS England is committed to reworking the clinical commission group (CCG) assurance framework for 2016-17 to reflect the triple aim of closing the gap on health inequalities improving the quality of care and achieving financial sustainability in addition to the themes of the Five Year Forward View: prevention; patient and community engagement; clinical priorities; and development of new care models.Cancer has been identified as one of these clinical priorities and metrics will be selected which reflect the strategic priorities laid out by the independent Cancer Taskforce including early diagnosis and supporting people to live well with and beyond cancer.The assessment framework brings together the assurance framework and key metrics and will incorporate future transformation as well as current performance. It will drive improvement rather than just assure and assess.CCGs will receive an overall annual rating and within the framework will be rated for six clinical priorities of: cancer dementia diabetes mental health maternity and learning difficulties.CCGs will be rated on the same four point scale used by the Care Quality Commission: outstanding good requires improvement or inadequate. The ratings for the clinical priority areas will be made by independent expert committees.The metrics are currently in development and NHS England expects to publish a set for consultation in December 2015 at around the same time as the planning guidance with a final version in March 2016. The assessment framework will come in to operational effect from 1 April 2016 and initial ratings in the six clinical priority areas will be published in June 2016.Our comprehensive childhood obesity strategy due to be published in the new year will be looking at areas for potential action including diet and sugar consumption which are risk factors in poor oral health and tooth decay.The Department is working with NHS England to test a possible new dental contract which will increase access and improve oral health. Building on earlier pilots we are about to move to a new stage of testing by establishing prototypes. The new dental prototypes will continue to test a clinical care pathway focussed on preventing future dental disease. This approach includes offering patients personalised care plans and advice to both patients and parents on diet and good oral hygiene.In 2014 Public Health England (PHE) published an evidence informed toolkit for local authorities to support their work on oral health improvement among children and young people. PHE also published an evidence based toolkit for dental teams to support preventive advice and treatment for their patients. These toolkits include oral health improvement programmes and advice focussing on a healthier diet and reducing the consumption of free sugars.In addition these toolkits include other methods to improve oral health for example tooth brushing programmes and fluoride varnish application.The PHE report Local authorities improving oral health: commissioning better oral health for children and young people: An evidence-informed toolkit for local authorities is attached and can be found at:www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/321503/CBOHMaindocumentJUNE2014.pdfThe PHE report Delivering better oral health: an evidence-based toolkit for prevention is attached and can be found at:www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/367563/DBOHv32014OCTMainDocument_3.pdfImproving oral health"},
    {"label":"Jeffrey M. Donaldson","value":"I value Scotlands place in the United Kingdom and I will fight passionately for the right of Scottish MPs to have a say in matters that affect Scotland. The point that was made about the Barnett consequentials is very important. We lack clarity and we need clarity in this discussion.When it comes to legislation in Northern Ireland we have different types of devolution. For example an important issue in Northern Ireland at this time of year is the question of parading which is a non-devolved matter. We are in ongoing discussions between the political parties and we hope to come up with a new system for dealing with parades. We need it badly but it will be this House that will legislate on the new system. What if we follow the logic of the argument that is being made? As it is a matter that affects only Northern Ireland only Northern Ireland MPs would be able to vote on it. That is muddled thinking. I am not suggesting that that should be the case but how do we define what is and is not devolved? Parading is a non-devolved matter but elements of the legislation would be devolved. Policing is a devolved issue as is justice and those things impact on parading so where do we draw the line? That is my difficulty with the Government&;s proposal.The Democratic Unionist party recognises that the issue needs to be addressed. There have been comments about the need for generosity on the part of the English and I recognise that the question is important to people who live in England and needs to be addressed but this is the wrong way to do it. I agree entirely with the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) and the DUP supported the concept of a constitutional convention. The Union is too important. The integrity of the United Kingdom is too important to be left to a debate on Standing Orders in this House. That is not how we should be dealing with these issues and I say that as a passionate Unionist.All I am saying is that it places you Mr Speaker as the Speaker of this House of Commons in an invidious position. You will have to adjudicate on these matters daily and I do not think that is how we should deal with the question of how to handle English laws. It requires a much wider constitutional debate and this is not the appropriate way to defend and protect the integrity of the United Kingdom. It raises too many questions and frankly plays into the hands of those who want to go down the road of separation. Will we look back in a few years&; time and rue the day that this happened?I do not for a moment believe that the Leader of the House is acting out of any other motivation than a desire to address this issue and to do so from a Unionist perspective but I cannot agree with the method that he is suggesting. We need to go back to the drawing board and to find a way forward on which we can all agree. That is why there is a need for greater discussion and I would welcome more engagement with the Leader of the House on these questions.This proposal raises many issues about how the matter will be handled in the future. For example a lot of legislation for Northern Ireland and other parts of the kingdom is dealt with by Orders in Council and statutory instruments. We need to tease out how all that will be handled. Points have been made about the Barnettconsequentials and this is important because as the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) mentioned we have a crisis in the Northern Ireland Executive over welfare reform. We have full legislative devolution on welfare reform but the difficulty is that the Treasury has made it clear that we must implement welfare reform as it applies in the rest of the United Kingdom or we will not get any more money. How do we handle such issues in this House? How do we as Northern Ireland MPs have an influence on that issue in this House? I cannot see the answer to that in the Government&;s proposals. That is why I think that there is a need for a deeper and wider discussion on these issues. This is too important to be left to a one-day debate on Standing Orders in this House. That is why today the DUP is joining others with whom we might not see eye to eye on constitutional issues. We want the best for the United Kingdom and frankly this proposal is far from the best.It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. I commend all who have spoken especially the Chair of the Select Committee on Defence the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart). I have the privilege of being a member of the Committee but do not attend as often as I might like because of other commitments back home in Northern Ireland to do with the peace process but what he said made a lot of sense. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard) vice-Chair of the Committee made an excellent contribution too. It has been a pleasure to serve on the Committee during this Parliament. The work that it has done has been of real value and when a cross-party Committee of this nature comes together and says clearly to the Government that a minimum of 2% of GDP should be allotted to defence spending the Government should listen to the wisdom of that Committee. We look at these issues week in and week out taking evidence and examining all the facts.Judging by what I have heard today there is a high degree of support for the need to get on with the task of strengthening our armed forces and the United Kingdom&;s defences especially in the light of our improved economic conditions. Other speakers have rightly said that the world around us is changing as is the nature of the threat against the United Kingdom and our allies. That threat emerges in various locations and our capacity is being spread and stretched. I know that there are plans to enhance and improve our armed forces but we believe that it will be critical for the incoming Government to make a clear commitment to spending 2% of our GDP on defence.I shall go further than that. I acknowledge what the hon. Member for Birmingham Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) said about the debate not being party political and I entirely accept that. However the Democratic Unionists are a small regional party in this Parliament and we might have some influence over who forms the next Government. Let me therefore place clearly on record so that there can be no doubt and so that this does not become a bargaining chip&#8212;it will not&#8212;that we will only support a Government of this nation who make the commitment to a minimum of 2% of GDP being spent on defence. That is not a party political comment; it is simply something that we believe to be important.We have been accused in the past of focusing our interest narrowly on Northern Ireland. It has been said that when it comes to negotiating with coalition Governments or in confidence and supply arrangements we will always be there with the begging bowl on behalf of Northern Ireland but that is not the case. We have spelled out today certain key areas on which we want the next Government to make commitments on national issues. We are focusing on the national need and what is in the interests of the United Kingdom and right at the top of that list are the defence and security of this nation and the need for a commitment to 2% of our national income being spent on defence. I agree that it is not enough just to make that commitment and that it needs to be made clear how the money will be spent. It must be spent wisely and it must be prioritised towards the areas in which it is required.Looking at the world around us we see that we have two aircraft carriers under construction. The Queen Elizabeth is now being fitted out and the Prince ofWales is being built. There must be certainty that both ships will be brought into service and properly equipped with airframes and aircraft. We need a credible carrier force. That will be an essential component of our defence strategy&;s capacity and global reach not only in defending this nation&;s security but in providing security to our allies. That needs to be a priority.If I may say so one of the mistakes that this Government made was to scrap our surveillance aircraft and to cut up the Nimrod aircraft. That was frankly an act of madness. We now have Russian aircraft flying around the coastline of the United Kingdom but we do not have the capacity to deal with it properly. We need to do something about that. That is an area of our armed forces that could with extra expenditure be re-equipped to enable surveillance globally but particularly around the shores of the United Kingdom. The British Isles need defending&#8212;they need watching in the most literal sense&#8212;but our maritime surveillance capabilities are currently well below par. Vladimir Putin respects force and we need to respect it too. We need to be able to show that we as a nation have the military capacity to defend ourselves against any possible attack.Beyond equipment we need to get the strategy right. Many Members have already referred to the strategic defence and security review. I stated in an earlier debate that we needed to bring forward that review but in any event it is clear that the current SDSR is not fit for purpose because the world has changed and things have moved on. It is therefore essential that we get the next SDSR absolutely right. We will need to know why and on what the 2% of national income will be spent and to set that in the context of our strategic needs and defence requirements. That is not just some marketing commitment to be waved around as a policy commitment during the election. We need to know exactly what the policy will mean in terms of the numbers what the money will be spent on and what our strategic requirements are for national defence and security.Beyond capabilities and strategy we have to consider the daily needs of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. I get worried when I see the provision of housing and catering for our armed forces personnel because decisions on these matters are often taken on the basis of the lowest tender that comes into the Department. I have had many complaints from members of the armed forces about the quality of the services that are put in place to support them. We need to improve on that. It should not always be about the lowest tender.I appreciate that. I have the greatest respect for the Minister and I know from our conversations how deeply and strongly he feels about supporting those who have served in our armed forces. I take on board the point that he has made. My concern however is for those who are beyond that point particularly those who are suffering from mental trauma. There is a need to do more to support those members of our armed forces. We need to support through infrastructure those who serve our nation.I want to conclude by mentioning the reserve forces. We have put a lot of emphasis on their work and there is an urgent need to embed more regular personnel into the reserve forces to help with the training regime there so that they are better trained and so that we improve the levels of manpower retention. As Ministers know we have been very successful in Northern Ireland in our recruitment capacity. Many of our units are already fully recruited and we want to build on that work.I welcome this debate. The Chancellor recently said:&#8220;We can afford whatever it takes to provide adequate security. Defence comes first.&#8221;If in the next Parliament my party is called upon to support a Government that Government will need to be one who mean just what the Chancellor said.I was amused by the comment made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) about the need for wide-screen TVs if all parties take part in the debates. The hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long) said from a sedentary position that it would be a bit like the game show &#8220;Take Me Out&#8221;. I am not sure that I would want to take part if Sinn Fein was involved because &#8220;take me out&#8221; might have slightly different connotations. Perhaps &#8220;Blankety Blank&#8221; would be a more appropriate name given that Sinn Fein Members do not take their seats in this House. That is a serious point that it is worth making in this debate.In Northern Ireland we have traditionally had debates with the local political parties that participate in elections and that has worked reasonably well. I do not think that the DUP would have raised this matter today had it not been for the proposal particularly from the BBC to include parties that contest seats only in certain regions of the United Kingdom&#8212;the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. An important principle was breached: that the main debate was about the national scene. I think that there is a lot to be said for the idea that the debate should be between the two leaders who are most likely to be Prime Minister and to lead the next Government of the United Kingdom.If that debate is extended especially to include parties that contest seats only in certain regions then there is no valid reason to exclude Northern Ireland. If that occurs the question as others have asked is this: why then would only one party from Northern Ireland be included? If we look at the political parties represented in this House we see that the Democratic Unionist party is the fourth party in Parliament and four of the parties that it is now proposed should take part in the national debate have fewer seats in this House than the Democratic Unionist party. That puts us in a unique position with regard to the national issue.My second point is that everyone out there who is commenting on the likely outcome of the general election&#8212;including most recently Lord Mandelson&#8212;is saying that a hung Parliament is inevitable. Therefore with regard to the complexities of the next Parliament and the question of who will form the next Government there is a strong possibility that the Democratic Unionist party will be a factor in determining who forms the next Government. There is no prospect of Sinn Fein being a factor since its Members do not take their seats. Therefore their participation in debates at the national level is frankly irrelevant. I mean no disrespect whatsoever to the SDLP but I do not think that it will play a major role in determining who forms the next Government since it is already aligned to one of the parties that could form the next Government.Therefore with regard to the national debate and the public interest it could reasonably be argued that the Democratic Unionist party is the only party from Northern Ireland whose policies would be of interest to voters from other parts of the United Kingdom since they might have a bearing on who forms the next Government.My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is interesting is it not that Sinn Fein declares itself to be the strong supporter of Irish freedom and independence yet wants to take part in a national debate that is relevant to the United Kingdom. The very same party is acting in a way that suggests it wants to hand back all the powers we have in our devolved Assembly and Executive to the national Parliament of the United Kingdom and it really raises a question about their credentials as Irish republicans that they are in favour of returning to direct rule rather than honouring the agreements that have been reached and are moving forward&#8212;but I digress.The hon. Member for Belfast East said that we should not really be debating this issue because there are more important matters to debate. I simply point out that on every opportunity that the Democratic Unionist party has had as the fourth party in this Parliament to discuss matters&#8212;this is relevant to the wider issue&#8212;we have sought to focus not on issues that are relevant only to Northern Ireland but on issues thatare relevant on the national stage and they are issues that are important to the people we represent. This afternoon we will debate another motion that is of national significance as well as of importance to our constituents in Northern Ireland.We are all concerned about declining participation in the democratic process in the United Kingdom with voter turnouts and membership of political parties going down so this is an important issue. In fact I would argue that few issues are more important than encouraging people to respect and participate in the democratic process because that is about democracy itself. Indeed one of the two gentlemen who may well be the next Prime Minister seemed to think the question of TV debates important enough to devote the entire exchange in Prime Minister&;s questions to it.I beg to moveThat this House notes the First Report of Session 2013-14 from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on the Implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland HC 51; further acknowledges the recommendations of Lord Ashcroft in his report on The Veterans Transition Review; and calls on the Government to ensure the full implementation of the Military Covenant throughout the UK including in Northern Ireland.I am delighted to move the motion in the name of my right hon. and hon. Friends relating to the implementation of the armed forces covenant across the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist party is proud of the contribution made by men and women from throughout the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland who serve in our armed forces and who have served the United Kingdom in many theatres of conflict across the globe. We will make particular reference to Northern Ireland in this debate.Operation Banner was the longest-running military operation in the history of the British Army. In the course of that operation a high price was paid by the members of our armed forces and we pay tribute to them today. They include 502 soldiers from the Regular Army seven from the Territorial Army five former regular soldiers 196 members of the Ulster Defence Regiment&#8212;a regiment which I was proud to serve&#8212; 40 former members of that regiment seven members of the Royal Irish Regiment four from the Royal Air Force and two from the Royal Navy. We salute the memory of all those brave souls. Today many people in Northern Ireland enjoy life because of the sacrifice of those who were prepared to put themselves in the front line in defending the entire community against terrorism.I very much appreciate the hon. Gentleman&;s kind remarks. He served with distinction in Northern Ireland and to this day carries the scars of his service and the memories of those who did not return home with him. He rightly says that we supply about 20% of the reserves deployed on operations and I am delighted to see the reserves Minister the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier) in his place as he is a good friend to Northern Ireland. We are very proud of the contribution those soldiers make to the armed forces of the United Kingdom.In respect of the implementation of the armed forces covenant it is therefore important that those who come from Northern Ireland and those who reside in Northern Ireland have the same access to the support treatment and care they require when they retire from the armed forces as applies across the UK. A significant number of veterans live in Northern Ireland not only the many who served during Operation Banner but others who have served in more recent conflicts. With the draw-down from Northern Ireland and the end of Operation Banner some facilities that were available for the care andtreatment of the armed forces in Northern Ireland are no longer in place such as the Duke of Connaught unit at Musgrave Park hospital a specialist military facility that closed after Operation Banner. That has created a greater reliance on the NHS and the facilities that can be accessed by all the public in Northern Ireland.I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention and I will deal with that issue in some detail later. It is worth noting that the armed forces covenant is designed to ensure that veterans are not disadvantaged by virtue of their service in accessing the care treatment and support they require. There is at times a misunderstanding about what the covenant means in terms of equality legislation and so on and we need to address that.I have made reference to the troubles as they are sometimes described in Northern Ireland. A recent report by the World Health Organisation on post-traumatic stress disorder&#8212;PTSD&#8212;identified that Northern Ireland has a higher incidence per head of population of PTSD and trauma-related illnesses than any other conflict-related country in the world including places such as Israel and Lebanon where there have been sustained conflicts for many years. The study found that almost 40% of Northern Ireland&;s population had been involved in some kind of conflict-related traumatic incident. The survey estimated that violence has been a distinctive cause of mental health problems for about 18000 people in Northern Ireland&#8212;given the population size that is significant. Yet no specialist provision has been made to take account of the fact that because of the conflict Northern Ireland has a higher proportion of people with trauma-related mental illness than arises in other parts of the world. That is particularly the case for the ex-service community; the Police Service of Northern Ireland has a specialist facility funded by government that seeks to treat officers and former officers for trauma but there is not quite the same facility for the many more who served with the armed forces.In fairness I must mention the Royal Irish Regiment after-care service which is a unique provision for Northern Ireland and which the Democratic Unionist party fought very hard to achieve. When the home service battalions of the Royal Irish were being disbanded we felt that it was important that an after-care service was put in place to provide welfare support for those who had served constantly on the ground in Operation Banner over many years. We are talking not about soldiers who did a six-month tour of duty and then left for two or three years and came back but men and women who were on the ground all the time and constantly on duty. Even when they were off duty they could not relax because many lost their lives at such times. The level of stress that that must have brought on those individual soldiers and their families is enormous. There is a price for that and we need to be cognisant of it. Thereforethe armed forces covenant is important in Northern Ireland in ensuring that the level of support is consistent with the level of need.I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. As I alluded to earlier the perception often does not match the reality. I take her point and I come to section 75 now.I had a number of cases of veterans who required health care support on which I was in correspondence with the former Minister for Health Mr Edwin Poots. He pointed out in a letter to me that there were constraints within his Department on providing adequate support for the veterans&; community although he did establish an armed forces liaison forum which was linked to the armed forces protocol. As the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) pointed out some valuable work has been done by the Department of Health under DUP ministerial control to co-ordinate the health and social care response to the needs of service personnel and veterans in Northern Ireland.On occasion however when officials are interpreting that policy and the protocol they are allowing the equality provisions to get in the way of providing the support that is required. The Equality Commission has a job to do in educating our civil service on what thearmed forces covenant means as regards ensuring that veterans are not disadvantaged by virtue of their service. We are not looking for special privilege; that is the point. We want to ensure that they are not disadvantaged as there is some evidence that suggest that Departments are acting in a way that disadvantages members of the armed forces.I am very happy to acknowledge that work and to commend Dr Farry for the work he has been doing to ensure that those leaving the forces have access to higher level education.Indeed I also want to mention the Department for Social Development which has been undertaking work to ensure that the housing needs of veterans are met. There are still problems however. I had two soldiers in my office last Friday who are in the transition phase and have encountered real problems in being rehoused under the Northern Ireland housing selection system. More work needs to be done in this regard to ensure that soldiers leaving service are not disadvantaged by having to join a waiting list when the situation might have been different had they been living ordinarily in their community. The two soldiers have been resident in Lisburn in Thiepval barracks in my constituency for some time. They have been living in the city but when they joined the housing selection list they were treated almost as if they were newcomers. We need to look at that and to bring about some clarity.That brings me to section 75 and the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson). When what was then the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was making its way through this House we tabled an amendment the effect of which would have been to add veterans of our armed forces to the list of categories of groups protected by section 75. That is important because had our amendment been accepted it would have cleared up once and for all this misunderstanding about the status of veterans of the armed forces in the equality legislation. Section 75 covers everything from people of different religious belief political opinion racial group age marital status or sexual orientation people with disability and so on. We would like the veterans of our armed forces to be specified as a distinct group under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 so that it is absolutely clear to every Department that under that equality legislation they have an obligation&#8212;indeed a statutory duty&#8212;to promote equality when carrying out their functions. All that means is that the armed forces and veterans are treated fairly and equally and that they are given a distinct status under the current legislation. We believe that that would bring the clarity required to the current law and end any ambiguity that there might be in the minds of civil servants. We urge the Government once again to consider this minor amendment to section 75 which does not alter in any way the statutory dutyplaced on Departments and authorities but ensures that veterans and the armed forces are properly treated when it comes to meeting their needs.I mentioned the Royal Irish Regiment aftercare service and the continuity the service provides and again we urge the Government to ensure that it is properly resourced into the future. The need is not diminishing. In fact there is a lot of evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder for example only becomes apparent several years after a member of the armed forces has left service. To suggest that we cease the aftercare service for the former home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment would be a mistake. We need to continue that service to ensure that the thousands of soldiers who serve continuously in Northern Ireland on operational deployment 365 days of the year are properly looked after not just now but in the future.I thank my hon. Friend for making that point; he is absolutely right.Lord Ashcroft was commissioned by the Prime Minister to undertake a review of the transition for veterans leaving the armed forces and entering the community. His report made two specific recommendations in relation to Northern Ireland. First and significantly he recommended the need to amend section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act to enable service leavers and veterans to receive the recognition and provision they deserve. Again we call Lord Ashcroft in aid of our argument that we need that legislation to be amended.Secondly Lord Ashcroft recommended that the Government should appoint a security-vetted armed forces champion in Northern Ireland to enable service leavers and veterans to claim entitlements without fear for their personal security. That remains an issue for many veterans because in parts of Northern Ireland there is still a threat and they are still targeted by those elements in our society that do not support the peace process.I hope that the Government will reflect on those recommendations. It is disappointing that the Cabinet Office response did not refer to either recommendation. I therefore call on Ministers today to reflect on the proposals to amend section 75 and to appoint an armed forces champion in Northern Ireland. Perhaps an armed forces champion could also serve on the reference committee that meets regularly to discuss implementation of the military covenant. Northern Ireland is not represented on that committee because unfortunately there is one party at the Executive table that will not agree to the appointment of a military covenant representative.I understand the hon. Lady&;s point entirely. I have not made specific reference to that because it is not within the scope of the debate. However when we tabled our amendment to the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we sought to include another category that would have involved all the innocent victims and survivors of the conflict in Northern Ireland which of course would have included the Royal Ulster Constabulary the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve the Police Service of Northern Ireland and so on. I emphasise the use of the word &#8220;innocent&#8221; in our definition of a victim. I of course take the hon. Lady&;s point.There are some very good facilities in Northern Ireland. I commend the excellent work of the military charities in Northern Ireland particularly the Royal British Legion SSAFA Combat Stress which has done some excellent work helping those with post-traumatic stress order and the various regimental benevolent funds which are often overlooked but are quietly undertaking work with former members. They do a very good job and have worked throughout the period of Operation Banner quietly supporting the armed forces and our veterans. But we sense that there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach in the implementation of the covenant.That is why we&#8212;I my right hon. Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) and others&#8212;met the Prime Minister and sought a commitment from the Government to assist us with the establishment of a dedicated centre in Northern Ireland to meet the needs of veterans. This would bring together some of the military charities and the Veterans Agency as a kind of one-stop shop for veterans. There is support for this within the armed forces community in Northern Ireland and among the charities and we made some progress. We are looking for example to Help for Heroes. The people of Northern Ireland are very generous in their support of military charities. Every year without exception Northern Ireland contributes more per capita to the poppy appeal than any other region of the UK and one can understand why. We support generously other military charities including Help for Heroes and we have been in discussion with it. It is willing in principle to support the establishment of such a veterans centre in Northern Ireland.We ask the Government to give the proposal a fair wind and I am happy to meet Ministers at some stage to share with them the concept behind the veterans centre and how it might help to ensure full and proper implementation of the covenant in Northern Ireland by helping to educate people about the services already available. We are talking not necessarily about additional services but about bringing together existing services and signposting veterans towards them.Finally I refer to the community covenants. We do not have any in Northern Ireland at present which I think is a major deficit. Somewhere in the system there seems to be a reluctance to see the implementation of community covenants. In my own constituency the city of Lisburn we have the headquarters of the Army in Northern Ireland the headquarters of 38 Brigade and we now have 2 Rifles garrisoned there. We would dearly love to have a community covenant that would encourage much more interaction although some already exists. Lisburn is very welcoming of the Army. It always has been and always will be but we believe that the community covenants would help to encourage an improved relationship between the armed forces garrisoned in Northern Ireland and local communities.In comments to the Welsh Affairs Committee on 30 October 2012 the present Minister for the Armed Forces the right hon. Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr Francois) highlighted the particular challenge of implementing the community covenants in Northern Ireland. In his evidence to the Committee he recognised that some local authorities in Northern Ireland controlled by Sinn Fein and sometimes unfortunately aided by the SDLP seem reluctant to examine the potential of the community covenant. There is a sensitivity surrounding the issue which acts as a deterrent within the system. Even councils such as Lisburn city council which are more than willing to introduce a community covenant keep hitting a brick wall. I have encountered this. For some time I have been encouraging the council to introduce a community covenant and the council tells me that when it tries to do so there is a problem somewhere in the system.My right hon. Friend puts his finger on the point. Northern Ireland seems to have a slightly different system for the establishment of community covenants than that which applies in other parts of the United Kingdom which involves a role for 38 Brigade. I have not yet been able to establish why but there seems to be reticence somewhere in the system about introducing community covenants. Some councils are willing to do this and we should therefore be encouraging it. I am happy to write to Ministers so that perhaps we can get to the bottom of this.The Democratic Unionist party supports the full implementation of the armed forces covenant in Northern Ireland. Some problems still need to be ironed out. We would like section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act to be amended to ensure that there is no ambiguity about how the covenant should be implemented by Government Departments and agencies in Northern Ireland. We would like to see the continuation of the Royal Irish Regiment aftercare service and the establishment of a dedicated veterans centre in Northern Ireland. Finally we would love to see each of the new councils in Northern Ireland introduce a local community covenant to improve relations between our armed forces and the community. I believe that that is what the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want.On this occasion I think that military intervention in Iraq in support of the Iraqi army and the peshmerga is justified but how often are we going to be in this situation? I believe that a review of the strategic defence and security review is scheduled for next year but should we not begin that review now in the light of all that is happening in the world today the downsizing of our armed forces and our capacity to respond to the situations we now constantly face? What if another front opens up? What is our capacity to deal with such a situation? As others have said mission creep is also a concern when entering a conflict without any degree of certainty regarding an end date or a time scale. We need to look at the strategic defence and security review urgently and address whether we are on the right trajectory with regard to the strength and capacity of our armed forces to deal with the situations that confront us.On the politics there are clearly huge problems in Iraq and just appointing a new Prime Minister will not fix them in and of themselves. The sectarian issues&#8212;whichare familiar to us in Northern Ireland&#8212;run deep in Iraq and we also need to take account of the Kurdish situation. The Northern Ireland Executive has a relationship with the Kurdish Regional Government through a memorandum of understanding and we have been working closely with them. We could do more to help not only the Kurds improve their governance arrangements in Iraq but the Iraqi Government themselves. Too often when our armed forces leave the battlefield we do not do enough to invest in the new politics required to enable the post-conflict transformation. We need to put more emphasis on the politics in the future.The right hon. Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) was absolutely right to say that we need to look at how we can counter this violent extremism. That means countering the narrative and not just here in the United Kingdom. We need to look at strategies such as Prevent. Are we doing enough in the UK to counter radicalism? Arresting those who we believe or suspect to be involved in preparing for acts of terrorism is one thing but getting to the root cause and source of that radicalism is something else and we need to consider that. We also need to help the Arab nations to counter extremism. There is an opportunity given our involvement in this conflict to get alongside some of our Arab partners and to work with them to counter extremism and to create a more effective narrative than that which exists at present.In addition to being a member of the Defence Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) I also chair the Causeway Institute a small non-governmental body in Northern Ireland which is involved in peace building in the region.I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and support the broad thrust of the Government&;s approach on these issues. In Ukraine and in eastern Europe generally it is important that we stand alongside our friends and that we recognise what Russia is trying to do. We are talking about not just Crimea and eastern Ukraine but what Russia has been doing for some time in places such as Transnistria Moldova South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia. There is a deliberate strategy to foment conflict and then for those conflicts to be frozen in a way that creates instability and gives the Russians influence in those regions.The role of Poland is important. I was there just last weekend and heard how concerned it is about what is happening in Ukraine. It is vital that we stand alongside countries such as Poland and the Baltic states. We need to reassure them that we will not countenance any situation in which they may face attack or incursion on to their territory.We have mentioned the role of the European Union but I have heard nothing about the role of the Council of Europe which embraces most of eastern Europe andhas a role to play in opening up dialogue on the long-term issues. Russia is a member of it. I wish to hear more about the Council of Europe&#8212;our place in it and its role in the difficulties that exist in eastern Europe&#8212;because it is tasked with the responsibility of promoting human rights and respect for the rule of law and building democracy and those are precisely the kind of issues that are at stake in relation to the situation in Ukraine Moldova and Georgia.Whether in Ukraine and eastern Europe or the middle east there is a recurring theme of religious intolerance and the persecution of religious minorities. We saw that not only in Ukraine but especially in the middle east&#8212;the Christian minority has been targeted Syria Iraq Libya and other countries in the region. The religious persecution of the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq had devastating consequences.We want the UK Government to take a robust position against ISIS and Islamic extremism and we are prepared to support military action where that is required. We hope the Government will consult the House as the need arises.It is right to support the Iraqi army and the Kurdish peshmerga forces. I welcome the Government&;s important decision to provide heavy armaments to them but the point was made about Turkey. We need to reassure Turkey that in arming the peshmerga there are not longer-term consequences for the situation between Turkey and the Kurds. It is a complex situation and we realise that the decisions that need to be made are difficult and challenging.The hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) made an excellent speech and some valid points. Democratic Unionist party Members endorse the view that there is a need to ensure that the Foreign Office and the security services our eyes and ears throughout the world are properly resourced. Like many hon. Members I have seen the valuable work that our diplomats and security services undertake in foreign places. That work is vital to our national security and properly resourcing it is important.Countering the narrative of the extremists is also important. One difficulty is the lack of consensus among western nations and others on how we should do that and on what the counter-narrative should be. Our narrative is about religious tolerance and respect for human rights but we need to find a way to communicate it especially to young people in those countries through social media and so on. We should support locally based organisations that work to counter the extremists&; narrative such as the Arab Network for Tolerance a small modest organisation that seeks to promote respect for human rights religious tolerance and so on in Arab countries. It is important that we do our bit to ensure that such organisations have support from the UK.Yes the use of hard power is necessary at times but support for what we do on a soft-power level is critical. We need to counter the narrative and explain our role inthe world. How can we be involved with our allies in championing the cause of human rights and respect for religious freedom and in promoting tolerance? The UK has a leadership role to play in that whether in eastern Europe or the middle east. We will continue to support the efforts of the Foreign Office the Ministry of Defence and others in taking the battle against the extremists forward.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I rise to speak not only as a Member of this House but as chair of the Northern Ireland First World War Centenary Committee. I also have the pleasure of representing Northern Ireland on the national advisory board for the commemorations.I thank the Minister for the excellent work that he and his colleagues have undertaken in providing leaderships for the centenary commemorations which is very much appreciated in Northern Ireland. The help and assistance that we have received from the Department in Whitehall has not gone unnoticed. I also want to thank my colleagues on the committee in Northern Ireland who represent all the key stakeholders involved in the commemorations for the excellent work they are undertaking. I will say a little more later about the programme being developed in Northern Ireland for the centenary period.Mention has already been made of the worldwide significance of the war. It helped to shape the history of Europe in the 20th century and its impact on the island of Ireland was particularly significant. Indeed arguably the events of that period continue to shape the history of Ireland today. Many of the men who fought in the ranks of the 10th and 16th Irish Divisions and in regiments such as the Royal Irish Regiment the Connaught Rangers the Royal Dublin Fusiliers the Munsters the Leinsters and the South Irish Horse were Irish volunteers committed to securing independence. Equally the men of the 36th Ulster Division who filled the ranks of the Royal Irish Rifles the Royal Irish Fusiliers the Inniskillings and the North Irish Horse were Ulster volunteers who believed passionately in maintaining the Union with Britain. The future of Ireland was shaped not on the streets of Dublin in 1916 but on the muddy blood-soaked battlefields of the western front where Irishmen from every province of the island fought side by side in common cause.The first Member of this House to lose his life in the war was an Ulsterman Captain Arthur Edward Bruce O&;Neill who was the Member for Mid-Antrim which is now represented at least in part by my hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley). Captain O&;Neill was killed in action while serving with the 2nd Life Guards at Klein Zillebeke ridge on 6 November 1914 at the age of 38. He was the father of Captain Terence O&;Neill who became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Captain O&;Neill served with valour. In November this year with Mr Speaker&;s permission we hope to hold a small act of remembrance at the war memorial in Westminster Hall in memory of the honourable Captain Arthur Edward Bruce O&;Neill MP.Another Member of this House to die in action during the great war while representing an Irish constituency was Major Willie Redmond. He was killed in action while serving with the 6th Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment at Messines ridge on 7 June 1917 at the age of 56. He was a committed Irish nationalist and brother of the leader of the Irish parliamentary party in this House. In the winter of 1916 months before his death and in the aftermath of the slaughter at the Somme Willie Redmond wrote these words to Arthur Conan Doyle:&#8220;It would be a fine memorial to the men who have died so splendidly if we could over their graves build up a bridge between North and South.&#8221;After the war the lines were drawn across Ireland and the bridges were broken down. We all know the history of the decades that followed that war. Today in the 21st century those bridges that Willie Redmond spoke of are being built. They are bridges of co-operationbetween the two parts of the island based on mutual respect&#8212;the kind of respect that was in the hearts of the men of the 10th and 16th Irish Divisions and the 36th Ulster Division who fought side by side at Messines in 1917. It is particularly poignant that Willie Redmond was carried off the battlefield by men from the 36th Ulster Division including Private John Meeke of the 11th Inniskillings.In honour of men such as Captain Arthur O&;Neill MP and Major Willie Redmond MP and the ideals they upheld we have chosen remembrance and reconciliation as the twin themes for the centenary commemorations in Northern Ireland. Our programme reflects that. On 4 August as we mark the outbreak of the war there will be a special service at St Anne&;s cathedral in Belfast representing all traditions on the island of Ireland current and past. We will then have a candlelight vigil at the cenotaph at Belfast city hall where representatives of the Government of Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland will come together in an act of remembrance. We hope to have for the first time in Northern Ireland the pipes and drums of the Royal Irish Regiment play alongside those of the Irish army band.We are planning other events as we look forward. I acknowledge as the Minister has reported to the House the excellent work being undertaken at Glasnevin cemetery. Not only have the war graves been restored to an excellent condition but the erection there of the cross of sacrifice is particularly symbolic and significant. As he pointed out the cross not only sits in the shadow of Daniel O&;Connell&;s monument the round tower but alongside Gladstone&;s grave. Sorry. I do not mean Gladstone who would not have been buried in Ireland&#8212;some people on my side of the House might have wanted to bury him in Ireland. I of course meant Parnell who was leader of the Irish nationalists. De Valera is buried there too. Alongside their graves we have that fitting memorial to the men&#8212;56000 of them&#8212;who left the island of Ireland and gave their lives in defence of our freedom.Looking ahead in 2015 we will join others from across the Commonwealth at Gallipoli where the Irish made a significant contribution at the battle there. In 2016 the centenary of the battle of Jutland there will be a particular focus on HMS Caroline which is based in Belfast harbour and currently being restored by the National Museum of the Royal Navy. I thank the Minister and his colleagues for helping us to secure not only the retention of HMS Caroline in Belfast but the funding that will now see her restored to her former glory and right at the heart of the commemoration of the battle of Jutland.In 2016 it is the centenary of the battle of the Somme which is seared into the collective memory of the people of Ulster. The men of the 36th (Ulster) Division were at the forefront of the battle of the Somme. On that fateful morning of 1 July thousands of those men lost their lives or went missing in action as a result of their heroic efforts. Indeed a number of them won the Victoria Cross. We are participating in the national project across the United Kingdom to mark the memories of the men who won the Victoria Cross during the first world war with the placing of a stone in their town of birth. This will be done not only in Northern Ireland but in the Republic of Ireland where the Irish Government have consented to receive thestones to mark these men. We very much welcome the fact that they will have their memories commemorated in that way.In 2017 we mark the centenary of the battle of Messines when the Irish Divisions fought alongside the Ulster Division. We intend to mark that particularly poignant occasion in a number of ways bringing together people from across the island of Ireland. Finally of course we move towards the centenary of the armistice in 2018. We are considering a major project that will leave a lasting legacy of the centenary of the first world war in Northern Ireland.I want to conclude my remarks with two quotations. At this time it is the people who served and those who were left behind at home that we remember most. Captain Wilfred Spender served with the 36th (Ulster) Division at the battle of the Somme. After the battle as he reflected on the heroics of the men who had gone out to fight that morning he wrote these words:&#8220;I am not an Ulsterman but yesterday the 1st. July as I followed their amazing attack I felt that I would rather be an Ulsterman than anything else in the world.&#8221;A number of those men won the Victoria Cross that morning. The sacrifice was enormous.The Minister mentioned the cultural side of the centenary with the war poetry and the music and all that is very important. I want to quote one verse from a poem written by Susan Adams from Pipers Hill in Lisburn in my constituency. It is a tribute to her son Private Ralph Adams of the 13th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles who was killed in action on 1 July 1916. She wrote this:&#8220;In afar distant land though his body now rests.Far from his home and the ones he loved bestStill deep in our hearts his memory we&;ll keepSweet is the place where he now lies asleep.&#8221;Those words remind us that whether in the far-off fields of France or in the graveyards across this United Kingdom it is the men and women who fought and died whom this centenary is most about"},
    {"label":"Ian Lucas","value":"I thank the Chairman of the Procedure Committee on which I was privileged to serve for preparing the report.I want to make two points. I think the Leader of the House has heard enough from me and I am grateful to him for his patience in listening to me. First I intervened on him to ask why MPs from Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland would be excluded from the English Grand Committee set up under these proposals but there would be no exclusion for English MPs from the Welsh Grand Committee the Scottish Grand Committee and the Northern Ireland Grand Committee. He gave me no answer. The reason for that is that MPs in this House are being treated differently a point made with superb eloquence by my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman).If the Leader of the House really believes in the Union and if he really believes in the equality of Members of Parliament in this place&#8212;I do passionately which is why I feel strongly about this and I hope he will forgive me for my short-temperedness at some stages in this process&#8212;then will he please see that he is giving an enormous gift to those who wish to split up the United Kingdom? I believe passionately in devolution. It is right and proper that we decentralise more within England and devolve to Wales and Scotland but this is not the way to do it. It has been a fractious bad-tempered and foul debate today one that I have not enjoyed listening to and this is just the start of the process. But the process does not address the needs of my constituents.My second point is that I represent the constituency of Wrexham in north-east Wales which is on the border. In my constituency&#8212;I will give one example but I could provide the House with more&#8212;NHS services are designed to be supplied from hospitals in England for example in Gobowen Liverpool Manchester and Chester. On the boards of those foundation hospitals are people who represent and are elected from the population of north Wales. The proposals will give me a second-class say on the future of those hospitals.As ever my position is different from that of the hon. Gentleman.One practical example from my parliamentary experience addresses the issue of the decisions made by the Speaker. The last Labour Government introduced legislation to establish foundation hospitals and these applied only in England. Health in Wales is devolved to the National Assembly but hospitals such as those in Chester and in Gobowen in north Shropshire provide services to patients from Wales. Indeed they depend on those patients paid for by the Welsh Government for their viability. From 1997 to 2001 I was a non-executive director of the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Gobowen approximately one third of whose patients come from north and mid-Wales. It depended for its financial viability on those patients continuing to come. Those patients depended upon MPs making representations in this place to Ministers to ensure that they were represented as patients on the boards of foundation hospitals in the same way as patients from England were.Although health is a devolved issue&#8212;I say this with particular reference to north Wales&#8212;it is essential that people in north Wales that Members of Parliament are able to speak up on their behalf draw to the attention of Ministers the fact that the issue existed and secure a change in legislation. No Speaker at the beginning of the legislative process&#8212;before any of these matters are discussed&#8212;will be aware of the issue. There will be no reason for the Speaker to recognise that it is not an England-only issue.Indeed.The proposed Standing Orders need to be changed so that representations can be made to the Speaker by Members on whether a Bill is an England-only Bill or an England-and-Wales-only Bill. Also legislation to be certified by the Speaker is defined by reference to the powers of the Scottish Parliament the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly but some powers are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and not to theWelsh Assembly or the Northern Ireland Assembly. That means that in criminal justice for example the Government could bring forward an England-and-Wales-only Bill excluding MPs from Scotland even though the Scottish Parliament has responsibility for justice matters and could legislate using the new procedures. However the proposed Standing Orders make no provision for a similar power for MPs from Wales despite the fact that Assembly Members have no powers in the area of criminal justice. For example if Parliament wished to legislate on the issue of using the Welsh language in courts in Wales there is no procedure in these Standing Orders to allow that matter to be referred to the Welsh Grand Committee to give MPs from Wales a double vote or to enable the double counting voting procedure to apply to MPs from Wales.I was talking about the implications of giving Welsh MPs&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;the same rights as MPs from England. Let us suppose for example that a future UK Labour Government dependent on Scottish and Welsh votes for an overall majority wished to lower tuition fees in England and this was vetoed in a Committee comprising English Members only. After the Committee the Education Secretary would have to defend in the House a policy with which he disagreed. In effect he would be the Education Secretary for England but England could have a Conservative majority. A Labour Minister cannot be responsible to a Conservative majority so the logical solution would be to have a Conservative Education Secretary. However there cannot be two Governments at the same time one for devolved matters and the other for non-devolved matters. A Government have to be collectively responsible for all their policies not just a selection of them. That is the type of situation that the Standing Orders will create.The Standing Orders will in practice increase the Conservative majority on English devolved matters from 12 to 105 at a stroke. When Labour set up the Welsh Assembly there were no Conservative MPs in Wales at all. With a majority of more than 150 in the House of Commons the Labour party introduced an additional member voting system in Wales to ensure that there was a balanced representation within the National Assembly for Wales. The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Antoinette Sandbach) would not have been elected to the National Assembly for Wales because she kept losing under the first-past-the-post system."},
    {"label":"Mark Durkan","value":"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bury St Edmunds (Jo Churchill) particularly as she ended by referring to off-patent drugs. She spoke powerfully on Second Reading of the Off-patent Drugs Bill which was promoted by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) only a couple of weeks ago. This debate draws on many points made in previous debates including that Second Reading debate and Westminster Hall debates. There have been debates about the cancer drugs fund specific cancers and recently secondary breast cancer.I am an officer of a number of all-party groups including that on cancer which is so ably led by the hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) who secured this debate. We have also heard from colleagues who are members of other all-party groups including the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) who is on the all-party group on pancreatic cancer and the hon. Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris) who is doing so much to raise awareness and to promote action on and understanding of brain tumours.I welcome the fact that the Backbench Business Committee has afforded us this opportunity to join up what might otherwise appear to be disparate work. The APPGs are not rivals&#8212;their efforts are entirely complementary. The cancer strategy is a benchmark document and this debate gives us an important opportunity to consider how we can marshal parliamentary effort and will behind it. We need Ministers in the Department of Health and elsewhere to know that we are not taking it for granted and that just because we have had unmet need for a long time that should not continue to be the case. I would like to hear a Minister tell us that their portfolio means that they see themselves as the Minister for meeting unmet need. If they set that target and seek to make that change and turnaround they will have many backing vocalists from the different all-party groups.Other hon. Members have said that there may be some issues with aspects of the cancer strategy but it clearly lays down some important standards not least on a recurring message that the APPGs get from the evidence we receive namely the question of early diagnosis.I fully recognise that point. That was what I was trying to say when I said that the APPGs are not rivals. This debate allows us to bring together their work and their common message and to acknowledge the work of the hon. Gentleman and the chairmen of the other APPGs. In that regard I should also mention the hon. Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson). She cannot be here this afternoon but she has done so much on the all-party groups on ovarian cancer and on breast cancer.Early diagnosis is a common theme and the issue is not just about making sure that there is more access to diagnosis. The hon. Member for Bury St Edmunds has mentioned how many people end up being diagnosed in A&amp;E which is not what should happen. Although certain cancers raise more sensitive and technical questions than others there needs to be more awareness among GPs and diagnostic tools are also key. However this is about not just ensuring earlier diagnosis with better use of diagnostic tools but ensuring much clearer referral pathways. The cancer strategy sets a target of making sure that by 2020 90% of people are diagnosed within a month to see whether or not they have cancer. That is a very good working standard.All the APPGs particularly the all-party group on cancer have strongly suggested that the indicator of one-year survival rates would be a very good test of our ambitions and efforts and of the actions of health authorities. That working standard needs to be adopted because it would help us to monitor and manage our progress.I am conscious of the fact that I speak as a Member from Northern Ireland whereas the cancer strategy and much of this effort relate to England. However as everybody knows in a lot of these areas we are talking about predictive policy. When we set frameworks or national strategies on particular diseases or illnesses for the NHS in England they can extend through policy airspace principles to the devolved areas. That is one reason why I have no hesitation in joining in the work of the APPGs here&#8212;it helps to advance understanding at home.Of course that was not the case with the cancer drugs fund. We do not have a Northern Ireland version of that which has led to the frustration that was identified by the late Una Crudden who suffered from ovarian cancer. Many of the drugs that were available in England under the cancer drugs fund had been the subject of clinical trials in the excellent centre in Belfast yet they were not available to patients in Belfast.The success of the cancer drugs fund has shown its limitations which is confounding us in thinking about how to develop and replace it. When considering the future of the cancer drugs fund and what will succeed it I ask him to think not just about doing something for England and then seeing whether the devolved Administrations can match it or do better but about the possibility of a UK-wide funding pool for some of the newer drugs and for some innovations in research and diagnosis such as molecular diagnostic testing which comes under the cancer drugs fund. Perhaps this is a conversation that we need to have with the Chancellor in the context of his announcement next week and what will happen beyond that. I am saying not that it should all be funded by London but that there could be a pool of money to which the devolved areas contribute with common standards and bands. It might be that certain groups of patients would then be covered by further arrangements made at the devolved level.The more commonality and consistency we can bring to funding the better. It would make it so much better for the many good cancer charities and policy advocacy groups that work with cancer patients which have to busk around the different Administrations to see who has what bit of money. That also creates a lot of confusion at the parliamentary level. It is hard for us to join up our efforts and marshal our arguments when we are dealing with different structures and systems. The more commonality we can create in funding particularly in the area of innovation the better.Perhaps there should be a UK-wide effort or perhaps it should go beyond the UK. The British-Irish Council includes all eight Administrations on these islands including the south of Ireland. Perhaps there should be a common effort at that level given some of the clinical networks that will be involved. When we consider the rarer cancers that will not be treated in some of the other places perhaps a more united effort would help to take the thinking forward. A lot of the ingredients in the cancer strategy for England might best be brought forward as part of a combined strategic effort on cancer across these islands.Will the Secretary of State accept that while many of us have misgivings over parts of the agreement including over what is not in it that does not in any way detract from our support for its positive aspects which we have long advocated and which we advocated in the negotiations including the whole-community approach to paramilitaries and the signing up by all parties to a uniform position on eradicating paramilitarism from our society? She said at the talks as she has said publicly and consistently that there would be no agreement on the past without an agreement on welfare reform&#8212;that that was the hard message for Sinn F&#233;in and the Social Democratic and Labour party. However we have now apparently ended up with an agreement on welfare reform but with no agreement on the past. People want to know how that came about. Would she consider publishing clauses on the past on a without-prejudice basis and committing them for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses so that they could be the subject not of some sort of private abeyance to be sorted out between herself and Sinn F&#233;in but of proper consideration by Members of both Houses here and by the public in Northern Ireland particularly the victims?As the MP for the constituency in which the events of Bloody Sunday took place I know that I have to take care not to go so far in rebutting some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth) that it adds to any impression of political pressure or motive behind the current investigation or indeed any arrest. Will the Minister confirm that one of the things that all the parties have agreed in all the discussions on the legacy is that amnesty is no basis for dealing with the past and that the House should therefore avoid getting involved when there are particular investigations or arrests?Will the Minister also qualify his last answer by saying that protection does not extend to perjury that Lord Saville warned several witnesses and that the prosecuting authorities took the position that they would pursue perjury&#8212;which would happen in this jurisdiction because that is where any possible perjury took place&#8212;only after what they called the substantive crime of possible murder was dealt with? Therefore if people are looking to say that the investigation of possible murder should somehow be parked or abandoned will he consult with colleagues to see whether the issues around perjury should be reconsidered by the prosecuting authorities?It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning Mr Davies. Like others I commend the hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) on securing this debate and on the helpful way in which he set out the terms of the debate which was helpful not least because as the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) said he covered all the technical terms and jargon meaning that none of the rest of us have to go over those hurdles. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Stafford for his steadfast and sterling work as the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on malaria and neglected tropical diseases. I try to attend the group&#8217;s meetings as often as I can and I appreciate not only the quality of his work but the calibre of the evidence and engagement that is brought to the group which powerfully demonstrates the range of commitment of a number of charities and campaign groups. We have also heard directly from companies not only about the quality of the work and their research but about the commitment that they have been prepared to make on things such as price sensitivity. We have also been able to see and hear how important the work of DFID is and about its various partners in the NGO sector and internationally and multilaterally.The rate of progress and advance highlighted by the hon. Member for Stafford in his introduction in many ways proves the power of marshalled will when we have multilateral actions and well defined global goals. For some it is fashionable to knock such initiatives but seeing real success against declared goals should incentivise us to do more and to go further. As the hon. Gentleman said when we might still be looking at 450000 or more children dying from malaria and neglected tropical diseases we clearly need to do more.This is a time for renewed commitment rather than complacency about the challenges. Tackling malaria and neglected tropical diseases will be key to achieving the sustainable development goals especially the health goal the realisation of universal health coverage and the reduction in maternal and child mortality. Achievement of the global malaria targets by 2030 will mean more than 10 million lives saved giving all that added productivity releasing all that quality of life and increasing economic activity.The UK should be seen to be prioritising sustainable development goal 3. We should therefore sustain and I hope increase the annual investment&#8212;&#163;536 million at present&#8212;to achieve malaria elimination. The UK&#8217;s malaria and reproductive health framework for results will run out this year so we need a renewed vision and a new plan for the UK&#8217;s contribution to global efforts towards elimination.DFID has the credibility so it should be seen to ensure that SDG 3 is more articulate about neglected tropical diseases by using its own working indicator on the number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases by 2030. Furthermore we should heed the caution of the hon. Gentleman about silo approaches which are understandable in the face of so many difficult challenges and so many pressures but it is vital that we do not miss the opportunity to use disease-specific vertical programmes for other diseases and other health challenges to contribute towards the defeat of other diseases. It is therefore important for the UK to continue to fund bilateral disease-specific programmes if we are to sustain the gains that have been made.There has already been some discussion of &#8220;elimination&#8221; or &#8220;eradication&#8221;. It is important whether we use and how we qualify such terms and the differences between them. The goal is in essence one of emancipation. When we achieve elimination or eradication we will have conquered a disease with all the ravages that it can bring including death disability or diverting the life opportunities of those who have to care for the sufferers&#8212;women and children in poor countries are affected in particular. At the same time we will need to remember that malaria and neglected tropical diseases are not only a face of poverty but a force for poverty not least in their impact on women and children.We need to see the whole effort as one of emancipation creating alternatives for people&#8212;not only lives no longer lost but lives that can be better lived and more fulfillingly expressed through economic contribution and in public life. That is why it is so timely that the hon. Member for Stafford has secured the debate and that is why it is so important that we encourage the Minister and everyone he works with in DFID to do everything that they can.This measure is not just a penalty against work; it is also a penalty against parenthood. Clearly there is a divergence of view in this House. Conservative Members have a view about how policy should support family and children that is at complete variance with mine. We heard from the Chancellor on the day of the Budget that&#8220;we on the Conservative Benches know that the wish to pass something on to your children is about the most basic human and natural aspiration there is.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report 8 July 2015; Vol. 598 c. 330.]Feeding children is an even more basic aspiration than that as is nurturing children and giving them warmth when they need it. We are talking about somebody being able to aspire to work to bring home food to their children and support to their family. These are the people who are going to be hit by the measures the Conservatives are introducing because it is the people working very hard and trying to do the best by their children and for their neighbours who will be betrayed by this measure.I do not accept the nonsense we heard from Conservative Members with some exceptions who were more or less trying to tell us that low-paid workers should now be the acceptable casualties of a dogmatic imperative of austerity &#8212;they should not. Nor do I accept the somewhere-over-the-rainbow nonsense that some Conservative Members were giving us that &#8220;It is all going to work out well. It will go so swimmingly and people are going to be so much better off when they see what they are going to get.&#8221; Clearly the way these measures have been brought forward will mean that people are going to suffer in the meantime. People will also lose jobs as well as lose income because some of us are hearing from employers in some sectors that they will not be able to give the pay increases without doing damage to the payroll that they currently have.Conservative Members need to realise that labels they put on this and all the clich&#233;s they come up with are not going to give buying power to the money they are leaving people with. Clich&#233;s will not be hard currency to support families who are being driven into poverty.As other hon. Members have said it is truly a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Hollobone. I want to begin by commending the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) on securing this debate and giving us an opportunity to discuss an issue that is important to many people and families in every constituency that is represented in this House. The issue is important not just because of the scale of cancer&#8217;s impact but because people are confused about some of the policies: the policy language and all the different funding mechanisms that seem to afflict delivery of treatments and options for new drugs.I endorse much of what the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) who chairs the all-party group on pancreatic cancer said about Abraxane. I too am an officer of that group. Abraxane is a perfect but terrible example of exactly the confusion and concern that people feel. Here is a drug that was supported by NHS England but will be withdrawn on 4 November. People do not understand why in this day and age with evidence-based policy and all the intelligence that we are supposed tohave at the disposal of the public policy system we have a snakes-and-ladders system that means that drugs are available in some places but not others or are available for certain periods but then are not.As the Minister will probably tell us part of the problem goes back to pressure on the Cancer Drugs Fund. The fund was a positive innovation but it was meant to be a transitional step&#8212;something to make good the problems with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and its approval system which was leading to poor rates of approval for many cancer drugs. Most of us across all political parties thought that there was a problem with drugs breaking through the NICE approval thresholds. The Cancer Drugs Fund was a deliberate innovation aimed at ensuring that in the short term more drugs would be available and used under that specialist mechanism with the intention that underlying problems and issues with the NICE regime would be resolved.Now the Cancer Drugs Fund has ended up with its own budget pressures. Thankfully the Government have topped up the fund over various periods but that applies to NHS England. In Northern Ireland where my constituency is we did not have a bespoke cancer drugs fund and we were caught in the twilight zone of drugs seeming to be available and being discussed in debates such as this as though they were available when they were not available in Northern Ireland. The terrible irony is that some of the drugs that were available under the Cancer Drugs Fund were the subject of clinical trials.The hon. Members for Strangford and for the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) referred to the centre at Queen&#8217;s. What I am probably most proud of in my political contribution is that as Deputy First Minister I insisted on securing funding for the regional cancer centre in Belfast. We designed it as part of the reinvestment and reform initiative. When we negotiated with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown I made it clear that we wanted a down-payment for the new borrowing power. The first thing we wanted to do was invest in the cancer centre at Queen&#8217;s without messing around with public- private partnerships or anything else. We wanted a straight-up investment.That cancer centre like so many others is working miracles every day but alongside the miracles performed by those who carry out surgery or lead the radiotherapy units that the right hon. Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith) discussed there seem to be debacles with funding policy and schemes.There is a question about what will happen. We are supposed to be looking at a merger of NICE and the Cancer Drugs Fund. The fund is meant to move on from next year but people who are directly involved and who deliver cancer services and campaign on cancer policy have no clear feeling about what is happening. People&#8217;s hopes are at stake and they are confounded by what has happened with Abraxane and many other drugs that will no longer be available from 4 November.We are blessed in this debate because the Minister not only speaks a lot about innovation but in many ways has become a bit of a byword for innovation&#8212;and not just in life sciences. I hope that he and his colleagues can be truly innovative in the policy instruments and funding mechanisms that they hope to introduce. A key issue which other Members have touched on concerns notjust provision of funding but control of prices and their negotiation. We must make sure not only that we have funding mechanisms that we understand but that there is real leverage in price negotiation if we are to make those drugs truly available.In these islands we have a number of different Administrations and perhaps we need to do more to achieve combined purchasing power strength. One of the most neglected and underused creations of the Good Friday agreement is the British-Irish Council which brings together all eight Administrations across these islands. That is a very good example of where those eight Administrations need to collaborate much more effectively combining their leverage to make sure that there is a more consistent and compatible policy on available drugs services and treatments and to provide strength in combined purchasing when negotiating.Devolution gives us the benefit of being able to innovate and take things forward in slightly different ways. I look forward to hearing the word from Scotland&#8212;from the hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Marion Fellows)&#8212; because as we have heard in previous debates Scotland moved to a new drugs fund that combined elements of the Cancer Drugs Fund with responses dealing with rare diseases. That too is subject to its own pressures and there are difficulties about what gets through and what passes the requirements test for funding and availability.Obviously we do not have clinical expertise or a full understanding but we are meant to be able to assist with policy constructs and governance and we can do more. We should encourage the Minister to work with colleagues not just in the devolved Administrations but also with the Irish Government&#8212;all eight Administrations across these islands&#8212;to do more with the drugs companies and to achieve better understanding.That would be a great help to the many people who provide key services innovating researching and conducting clinical trials not just in the cancer centre at Queen&#8217;s but in other locations throughout these islands. It makes it much easier for them if they know that they are working against a better policy-meshed backdrop at the level of government; that the challenge funds are there for their research work; and that the collaboration that they are trying to achieve with commercial companies is matched by real price leverage and positive price control effort as well as conscious usage planning on the part of Governments.As the right hon. Member for Oxford East said the issue is not just cancer drugs. Surgery is a key issue and none of us wants to understate its importance nor that of radiotherapy. In my constituency thankfully a radiotherapy unit will open in 50 weeks&#8217; time. It will be a cross-border unit again using some of the models and ideas in the Good Friday agreement. The new radiotherapy unit which will be part of the new cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital is funded by the Irish Government as well as the Northern Ireland Administration. It will make a huge difference to many people assisting them on their cancer journey and making sure that they have less arduous physical journeys.I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response and the ongoing work that I know he wants to do. I hope that he takes that work forward with colleagues throughout all the Administrations in these islands and not just with his Whitehall colleagues.In following the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) I will respond to his challenge to my party but I do not want to respond only to the issue of welfare reform and the challenges in the devolved budget resulting from the Treasury&#8217;s budget bullying tactics. The Treasury is imposing a fine on the block grant that is given to the Northern Ireland Executive under the Barnett formula. It adopted that tactic because it thought that creating budget stress for the Assembly would force through welfare reform but that budget stress became a budget crisis and that in turn is feeding a political crisis.The Treasury needs to take a different course. I ask hon. Members to contemplate what would happen if the British Government decided to introduce a provision in the Scotland Bill that would require any disagreement between Ministers in London and Edinburgh on welfare issues in Scotland to be resolved according to the terms they are using in Northern Ireland. How would those on the Treasury Bench react if some of us proposed a new clause that would specifically forbid the Treasury ever doing in Scotland what it is now doing in Northern Ireland: using budget interference to impose a different view of welfare reform?Although the scheme for devolution set out in the Scotland Bill is different from the notional legislative devolution that Northern Ireland has the fact is that there is a scheme for devolution there and it requires and presumes by the nature of the legislation agreement between Ministers but there is no provision for when there is disagreement. It certainly would not work if Scotland was to be treated in the way Northern Ireland has been treated. Therefore if the Treasury would nottreat Scotland that way in relation to the future of devolution and welfare it should not treat Northern Ireland that way now.Whether we call them fines or penalties as the hon. Gentleman and his party have done previously or savings forgone which is the language the Treasury uses they are the same thing and the result is the same: serious pressure on our budget. There are other pressures on our budget as a result of some of the choices that the Executive have made. They are not choices that I would have made when I was Finance Minister&#8212;given that my period in that office has been brought up&#8212;but they are not choices that I had to make either.Let me return to the issues that now confront all the parties in the Stormont House talks. Serious attention is rightly being paid to the question of paramilitarism in its various manifestations and manipulations. We are glad that that issue has come to the fore although we regret how it has come to the fore. In the scoping for the original Stormont House negotiations late last year we said that we wanted paramilitarism organised crime and criminality on the agenda. Unfortunately we did not get support from others because they did not seem to believe that it was a relevant issue. It clearly is. Many hon. Members have touched on some of the features of criminality that clearly derive from our troubled experience. Whether people want to pretend that some of these people are simply privateers having been privatised from some other paramilitary group or something else the fact is that collectively we have to confront what that means. We have done that before in previous debates on a cross-party basis&#8212;for example when looking at organised crime in the border areas and elsewhere.We as parties must also ensure that we are not divided on the issue of paramilitarism by taking a differential approach to it depending on what side of the community it appears to come from. We should avoid making different demands on and criticisms of the police according to their response or non-response to one feature of paramilitarism as opposed to another because that would send out a signal that we are still divided and that the paramilitaries are somehow attached to and serve particular sides. Nor should we create difficulties for the police. Parties should be robust in using the accountability mechanisms for policing to challenge and engage policing at all levels but we should not catch the police in the middle of our party political differences.That is why at Stormont House my party is advocating a whole-community approach to dealing with paramilitarism. If we are to create a whole community in Northern Ireland we need to overcome historical sectarian divisions and all the convulsive ruptures that aspects of our culture and traditions have sometimes brought about such as parades. At Stormont House&#8212;thisis often forgotten&#8212;we agreed new financial commitments on shared and integrated education but we need to go further. We need to invest in shared housing to build more intentionally shared communities close to the new shared education estate so that one will reinforce and support the other in changing society.When people voted for the Good Friday agreement&#8212;I am probably the only person in the Chamber who was there negotiating it and I take my share of whatever people want to say in the way of blame or criticism&#8212;we were proved absolutely right in the way we had done it. It was about creating transformational politics in Northern Ireland and not at best episodes of transactional politics where people appear to share power now and then and turn their backs on each other and let the community down at other times. We need to use these Stormont House negotiations not just to make good the better promises of Stormont House but go back to the original promises of the agreement.Several hon. Members rose&#8212;We have heard many compassionate and compelling words today and the voice of conscience has come through on both sides of the debate just as it has come through on both sides of the correspondence we have all received from our constituents. I will be opposing the Bill. Some of the constituents who have written to me have suggested that I am being Church-whipped. I am no more Church-whipped in opposing this Bill&#8217;s Second Reading than I was when I voted for the Second and Third Readings of the marriage equality Bill.Like all Members I come here today as a conscientious legislator dealing with difficult issues. I acknowledge the sincerity of the Members proposing the Bill but as a legislator I cannot satisfy myself that the compassion with which it has been proposed is adequate to allow it to pass. I am not convinced by the so-called safeguards that it is claimed to have and I do not believe that it would be enough to rely on codes of practice that might or might not be introduced in future.In that regard I am moved by what I have heard directly from many medical professionals. We have been privileged to hear today from Members with medical experience and insights about some of the difficulties that they see arising from the Bill. They are concerned about not only the professional compromises that would be created but the pernicious conditioning effect thatwould result. Many Members have rightly raised concerns about incidents of coercion arising in the discharge of this legislation but there are also concerns about the wider conditioning effect and many medical professionals have voiced those to me. They are concerned that it would affect their relationship not only with patients but with colleagues and other professionals because of the quandaries and difficulties that would arise.I am also not convinced by people making the case for the Bill by focusing on what would not be covered by it. I cannot take from them the assurance that the Bill draws a line and could not be used to take us on a travelator towards more legislation. If the compelling cases which motivated Members to propose the Bill would not be covered by it I find it hard to see how those same cases would not be used to take us on a further journey so I accept the slippery slope argument.It has been suggested that relying on the prosecution guidance as adequate would be a dereliction of duty on our part as legislators but let us remember that those who are proposing the Bill would still be relying on the guidance for all the cases that fall outside the scope of the Bill. If it is okay for people to rely on that guidance for cases that fall outside the scope of the Bill why would it be wrong for those of us who oppose the Bill to rely on it as well for people in that situation?I do not claim that we have moral superiority over anyone in the decisions that we take today but as legislators we are compelled to make those choices. I know that the choice I make as a legislator might not be the choice I would make as a terminally ill patient or as someone who receives a strong and emotional request from a loved one who is terminally ill or as a juror if a prosecution took place at some time; I must make the decision today as a legislator. That is why I must vote against what I regard as poor and dangerous legislation.I sat through the debates yesterday and today and want to address a number of the points that have come up rather than just rely on some of the helpful and poignant briefings we have received from so many people.One of the first things I want to do is acknowledge the tenor and content of the speech made by the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) as well as the scope of the motion. Contrary to the attempts by the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham) and others to misrepresent it people need to recognise that the motion clearly listened to the points that many Government Members made in yesterday&#8217;s debate when they said that in all the focus on the refugee crisis as it is manifesting itself in Europe we should not forget the refugee crisis in the camps in some of the countries surrounding Syria or the significant commitment that the Government are making to the efforts to support people affected by conflict in Syria and elsewhere. The motion clearly does that. It attempts to achieve consensus on some of those concerns and on the valid points made by Government Members yesterday.The most questionable point made by the hon. Member for Gloucester was when he complained that the motion&#8220;calls for a Government report to be laid before the House by 12 October 2015 detailing how that number can be increased&#8221;and stopped there. He forgot to say that the motion continues:&#8220;encompassing refugees already in Europe and including a plan for the remainder of this year to reflect the overwhelming urgency of this humanitarian crisis&#8221;.That is the point. If those of us who have signed the motion had been saying that we wanted to see refugees who are already in Europe admitted as part of the 20000 the Government are looking to admit over the next few years Government Members would say that we were trying to deny people in the camps the opportunity to be part of the that number. Our concern is not that people who are in the camps should not be admitted&#8212;we welcome the Government&#8217;s interest although again we would welcome an increase in the numbers&#8212;but that we cannot ignore those who are already in Europe. It was the overtone of disqualification in the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement the other day that particularly concerned me.In the debate yesterday and today many hon. Members touched on what prompted so many of our constituents to mobilise and get in touch with us. A little over a week after the media were full of the photographs of the Prime Minister on a beach in Cornwall a different beach photograph emerged in the media. It brought out those words of Seamus Heaney about something having the ability to&#8220;catch the heart off guard and blow it open.&#8221;That is what that photograph of Alan Kurdi did.We heard the response from so many of our constituents and we know what the response has been internationally but let us be clear. That photograph stirred our constituents and in turn seemed to spur the Prime Minister into altering his tone but let us think about another Alan who might arrive on a beach or somewhere else in Europe having survived his perilous journey but alone and unaccompanied. What is the message in the Government&#8217;s response to that Alan? &#8220;He is disqualified. He is outside our consideration.&#8221; We even heard from the Prime Minister today that yes we do have to take care as to what we do with unaccompanied children and how we treat them but being careful is no reason not to show them care and consideration which appears to be the Government&#8217;s position. That needs to be revised improved and altered.I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has had his attitudes to this long-running problem reconditioned. Remember he was one of the leaders at the EU Council who went along with the idea that Operation Mare Nostrum was somehow encouraging people on to the seas. The line back then in autumn 2013 was &#8220;If we run rescue operations we will only be encouraging more people on to the seas.&#8221; At least now thankfully we have the Royal Navy the Irish navy and others helping to rescue but it took the disasters of April this year to force that rethink. The same caution from the Government Benches that we have heard in the past two days&#8212;that we have to be careful not to encourage people to make those perilous journeys&#8212;was exactly what was behind the disastrous decision in relation to Operation Mare Nostrum which did nothing to discourage the perilous journeys and meant that people were not saved and too many lives were lost.I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point which is correct. We know from Amnesty and others that a cogent case has been made in relationto a number of deficiencies in the Schengen agreement and the Dublin regulation which clearly need to be overhauled in the light of recent events.I agree with so many Government Members on a number of points that they have made not least the hon. and learned Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Lucy Frazer) and the hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood). We need to recognise the scale of the whole humanitarian crisis and not concentrate just on those who are arriving in Europe. We have to meet our responsibilities in relation to those who have made it to Europe and in relation to the wider crisis.The Secretary of State for International Development spoke of her concern not only that other countries were not matching the 0.7% aid target but that there was a significant shortfall in so many relevant UN appeals. Some of us would say that one of the ways to deal with that is through a global financial transaction tax. Part of the aim of those of us who have supported that idea is precisely to support funding for the sort of international mechanisms and measures that are needed rather than different UN funds having to busk around different countries trying to gather money for programmes. Although we have heard in these debates about the very good work in the refugee camps and elsewhere that is being funded through DFID and so many NGOs let us also be clear that UN funding in a number of those camps is being reduced. The level of food aid in some of the camps is being reduced and education support is not what it should be.In the previous Parliament the all-party group on protecting children in armed conflict led by Fiona O&#8217;Donnell produced a report that drew heavily on the lessons being learned from what is happening in Syria particularly in relation to the millions of children who have had to flee. It noted that when DFID and other organisations respond to such emergencies in the first order of things little thought is given to education. That might be understandable but when we consider just how long term many refugee camps have become for other conflicts&#8212;look at the Palestinian experience&#8212;we see that clearly more needs to be done. The world must respond not only to the immediacy of the refugee crisis but to the wider lessons about the inadequacy. Obviously the convention on refugees will have to be overhauled and so many other rules such as Schengen and Dublin will have to be revised.Of course these islands are outside Schengen. One of the things that I would like to see the UK Government do along with the Irish Government is convene a meeting of the British-Irish Council to co-ordinate across the devolved Administrations and with the Irish Government what the response will be across these islands in order to meet our responsibilities for accommodating refugees. That would ensure optimum co-ordination across jurisdictions and between services so that there is no fall-down breakdown or confusion facing international agencies or domestic charities when it comes to responding. The Government might find as a result of the information and ideas that would emerge from such collaboration that they are in a position to reconsider the number of refugees they are taking and the time scale not least by accommodating some of those who are already in Europe.Let us be clear that the Government having previously been averse to engaging with the UNHCR resettlement scheme and then having been very dilatory in relationto the vulnerable persons scheme have now moved to strike a tone of some urgency in this regard but of course limits have been put on it&#8212;the Prime Minister appears to have put the guard up on his heart again. The Government must be prepared to do more but those of us who are criticising them for the number of refugees they will admit or on the time scale must face the wider question about the scale of the problem in the camps about other conflicts not least in Sudan and South Sudan that are driving people into refugee status and about the need for a much bigger and longer-term response including proper support for the UN and a global financial transactions tax would be a good start.We are getting far off the Finance Bill.The Government told us that the Finance Bill should be taken as part of a whole suite of measures from the Budget including those in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. Yesterday we missed the six-year birthday of the Second Reading debate on the Child Poverty Bill in 2009 when the then shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions now the Home Secretary said:&#8220;When we talk about child poverty we are also talking about family poverty. Children are poor because their parents are poor&#8230;I would almost like to change the name of the Bill from the Child Poverty Bill to the child and family poverty Bill.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report 20 July 2009; Vol. 496 c. 613.]The measures in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill and the Budget tell us to forget that child poverty has anything to do with parental and household income and that the Government are going to abolish definitions of child poverty. We heard from the Chancellor of the Exchequer today at Treasury questions that he believes the Budget is offering a contract: higher wages for less dependence on welfare. He said that people would support that contract. I think more people will see the con trick in what the Chancellor is doing than the contract.Maybe they are away celebrating other people&#8217;s birthdays. [Laughter.] Maybe the hon. Gentleman having had so many interventions can now safely go and celebrate his. We all know he was here and not somewhere else. In the provisions on the national living wage and some of the other early clauses the Chancellor seems to be doing exactly what he decried his predecessors for doing: passing legislation to put restraints or constraints on himself. He is advertising in legislation his own behavioural discipline. It is the ultimate political selfie to put oneself into legislation. Some only last for the life of the Parliament yet are being put into legislation. How gratuitous a political exercise is that? Perhaps that is why other hon. Members cannot see fit to indulge the Bill too much.Government Members have said that the charter for budget responsibility is a key issue which it is but a key aspect of the charter is the welfare cap. In yesterday&#8217;s debate we heard references to the benefits cap&#8212;there has been much discussion about the benefits cap which affects households&#8212;but less attention has been paid to the overall implications of the welfare cap which was first introduced as part of the charter last year. If we look at what the summer Budget as opposed to the March Budget does for the welfare cap over the next four years we find some revealing figures. In the March Budget the overall welfare cap for the UK for 2016-17 was &#163;122.3 billion; in this Budget it is &#163;115.2 billion. For 2017-18 it was &#163;124.8 billion in the March Budget; it is &#163;114.6 billion in this Budget. It was &#163;127 billion for 2018-19 in the March Budget ahead of the election; it is &#163;114 billion in the summer Budget after the election. For 2019-20 it was &#163;129.8 billion in the March Budget; in this summer Budget it is &#163;113.5 billion. Over those four spending years that is a cumulative cut of &#163;46.5 billion as a result of the charter for budget responsibility and the welfare cap.Many Opposition Members&#8212;or perhaps not many of us as I think only 20-odd of us voted against the welfare cap when it was introduced&#8212;said that whatthe Treasury was bubble-wrapping as a neutral budgetary tool would turn into a vicious cuts weapon and now we see it in the name of the welfare cap. When there is so much discussion about the benefits cap people forget that the real story is the welfare cap and that will bear on people in my constituency and lead to more conflict around the next wave of welfare reform when it comes to the Northern Ireland Assembly.We heard earlier from the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) and we heard yesterday what he thinks the implications of the cap will be. If he was still here I would be saying to him directly that on this issue he and his party need to catch on; they have been wrong in the past and it is a bit late to be scrambling now when they have invited this very situation. Many of us told them that their support for the welfare cap on top of their support for the last wave of welfare reform in the Assembly would lead to this very situation but they told us to forget about those concerns because there was nothing we could do about it.Yes I certainly have no problem with that and I welcome the breadth of opposition. I also welcome the depth of opposition I heard from some hon. Members who because of their party&#8217;s Whips situation did not vote but whom I know care passionately about a number of issues and have served notice that they will vote in the amendment stages. I hope therefore that we can go further in this Bill and yesterday&#8217;s Bill to build on that.However let us be clear: this Bill purports to cover more than just the issues that we discussed yesterday. Hon. Members have referred to the questions around corporation tax and of course the Government have served notice that they are going to reduce it. I am someone who has supported the measures to give Northern Ireland the devolved capacity to vary the rate of corporation tax and I have no issue or argument against that. Indeed I predicted that one of the reasons why the Conservatives were so keen to devolve corporation tax was that they wanted to create an excuse or cover to do so in England and Wales as well.However although that can be welcome in Northern Ireland at one level because it means that the cost of any variation in corporation tax for us will be less in time let us be clear that contrary to what the hon. Member for East Antrim said yesterday it will not be parties such as mine holding these issues up; it will be the tactics and policies of the Government who are trying to create a budgetary arm-lock on the devolved Executive. They are basically saying &#8220;Unless you get your Assembly to pass the legislation that we want in respect of welfare reform we are going to create budget stress&#8221;&#8212;which in turn will lead to a budget crisis which in turn will become a political crisis&#8212;&#8220;as the price of your failure to do so.&#8221;When we are locked in that budget crisis&#8212;which will be contrived and the result of the Government bullying us on welfare reform&#8212;they will then say &#8220;You don&#8217;t have a balanced and sustainable budget; therefore you&#8217;re not getting your corporation tax powers.&#8221; Just as theGovernment said they would not introduce the corporation tax Bill until they were satisfied with what it looked like the Assembly was going to do on welfare reform so they have built in a clause for Northern Ireland in the Bill that says that come 2017 they will not switch on the power unless they are satisfied that there is a balanced and sustainable budget.When it comes to the outstanding measures in the Scotland Bill I hope that hon. Members present in the Chamber will be mindful of the possible need for a clause to prevent the Treasury from adopting any such tactic on the dual exercise of welfare powers between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament because the &#8220;twilight zone&#8221; difficulty that Northern Ireland has got into offers a very salient warning.I would offer the hon. Gentleman the mutual observation of respect but would also say first that we are not holding anything up. The legislation has already been passed. It provides for the switch-on of the powers in 2017. It is the Treasury that is imposing the condition and let us remember that it is locked on to that condition in a way that is completely wrong and unwarranted. It is basically saying &#8220;Yes you have the nominal legislative power over welfare reform but unless you do it exactly to our taste as karaoke legislation then we are going to interfere with your budget and claw back from the Barnett formula.&#8221; That is wrong. The Treasury has other ways of trying to control these things. If this is about welfare spending then the Treasury already has a welfare cap that allows it to police welfare spending&#8212;literally&#8212;without creating budget stress within the Executive and between parties so there is a different course that can be followed on all this.As for some of the other provisions I have no doubt that the Government will go further in their cuts to corporation tax. I know that they are saying that they want to get to 18% by 2020 but the Chancellor said in the second year of the last Parliament that there would be no more corporation tax cuts in that Parliament and of course there were. He is exactly lining up to do that again.Let me touch on some of the other issues. The hon. Member for East Antrim rightly mentioned the road fund in that the Chancellor said in his statement that the Government would have to work out exactly what would happen with the equivalent moneys in Northern Ireland&#8212;the money that would be raised in vehicle duties. However I hope it is not the case that only the moneys raised directly in vehicle duties in Northern Ireland would be hypothecated for those purposes. Given the nature of our economy and the fact that many of the key commercial vehicles on our roads are not registered in Northern Ireland&#8212;many of those servicing many of our companies not least in the retail sector come fromoutside the region&#8212;and also obviously given our higher rurality we have high relative overheads on roads so we would need something more than that.I asked the Financial Secretary earlier to clarify the position on banking because he seemed to be saying that the bank levy had largely served its purpose: the Government had had to introduce it but it was very much of its time and now we needed to move on to something different. Let us recognise that although clause 18 rightly says that in future banks will not receive tax relief on expenses for compensation payments made to customers in respect of certain defined issues until now the banks have been able to claim that tax relief. There is a catalogue of huge liabilities that they face because of their own wrongdoing but they were able to absorb all that along with the bank levy so it is not as though the bank levy was a serious burden to them.Of course the Government have responded to pressure from the likes of HSBC and StanChart who have been saying that they will move if something is not done about the bank levy. So the Government have moved on the bank levy but they are trying to tell the rest of us that that will be more than compensated for by the surcharge on corporation tax. If they reduce corporation tax by much more than they are currently advertising that surcharge will not amount to as much. Given how they have rolled over on the bank levy it is not very hard to canvass the suspicion that they will equally ameliorate the intended surcharge in response to the same threat.On renewables I do not intend to go on at anything like the same length or in the same colour as the hon. Member for East Antrim but I want to make it clear that there is a different view from Northern Ireland. We see the Chancellor&#8217;s measures as directly interfering in our capacity to have a greener economy and to grow firms and businesses. It is a key target of the single electricity market in Ireland north and south to achieve over 40% supply from renewables. It is a key element in the grid investment that is needed. It is also a key aspect of the market both north and south to seek to export in terms of renewables. The Chancellor&#8217;s measures therefore fundamentally interfere in one of the growth sectors in Northern Ireland. It is a growth sector not only in terms of generation but in terms of renewable technologies and the investment and export that goes with those. We take a fundamentally different view from that of the hon. Member for East Antrim. Let me be very clear: on issues such as contracts for difference we have different politics different starting points and different end points.I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the age restriction on the national living wage; the fact that it does not apply to under-25s is grossly wrong. The whole concept of the national living wage as put forward by the Chancellor is not only an attempt to slightly enhance or rebadge the minimum wage; it is a blatant attempt to puncture the living wage and to change its agenda and what is intended by it. That comes alongside other measures that we have discussed such as changes to tax credits which will directly take over &#163;1200 a year&#8212;over &#163;100 a month&#8212;from people who are in work.We are told that nobody who has more than two children at the moment will lose out as a result of the changes to the limits on child benefit; that will comelater. If we are really to believe what Conservative Members were telling us earlier&#8212;that the number of children that people are having is an economic choice to do with the availability of tax credits and the eligibility for benefits&#8212;we need to hear from relevant Ministers how they will cope with the baby boom that we will have before April 2017 as people ensure that children are born in time to qualify for benefits. There will be either a race for benefits or a race for births or both if we believe half of what we heard across the way yesterday.The new banking measures replace the big measures that were introduced by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor during the last Parliament otherwise known as Project Merlin. A fairly effete bank levy was intended to sort out the banks and put manners on them. Now we have a new Project Merlin: the Chancellor seems to have decided to take key social policies from Merlin Entertainments. A family means two adults and two children and no more. There is no deal for anyone who goes beyond that.As my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie) indicated we will vote against this Bill. I also have to say that I cannot accept all the reasoning in the amendment so we will not support the reasoned amendment either.Many people in this debate have made a number of points about this Bill. It removes even the term &#8220;child poverty&#8221; from the Child Poverty Act 2010. The Government&#8217;s answer to eradicating child poverty seems to be to delete all statutory references to child poverty. That is their policy on ending child poverty. Of course that has an impact not only on policies here&#8212;where there is accountability to this House&#8212;but on devolved policies. Did any consultation take place with the relevant devolved authorities whose positions are changed by virtue of this Bill if it passes into law?More importantly I am here because like many Government Members I want to see that work always pays but unlike them I am conscious of the fact that I will have thousands of constituents for whom work will pay less as a result of this Bill. People who are on working tax credits will see their position worsen. We see that by the changes to the income threshold and to the taper which will mean a difference of more than &#163;100 a month to many people straight off just from those changes alone. Other people will be affected by the freeze on other benefits. They include people who are not in work but it also affects people who are in work. It is as though the Government looked at all the speculation a number of weeks ago about what they would do and whether they would go for freezes for cuts or for caps or whether they would change the thresholds. The answer is that all of the above are in this Bill. The bottom line is billions of pounds of welfare cuts which will affect not just the Budget in overall terms in the way the Government want but family budgets in crucial and biting ways.In addition the Bill introduces the two-child policy. We know that Conservative Members will say &#8220;Well at least it is not quite Vulgarian and you don&#8217;t have to hide your first two children. Therefore it&#8217;s all right.&#8221; But the fact is that the Conservative party was not saying there should be a two-child limit when it came to the child tax allowances that it put through in legislation in the last Parliament. There &#163;2000 of childcare payments a year can be paid for every single child; there are no limits on the number of children for that and of course we know that 80% of the beneficiaries of those childcare payments will be in the top 40% of the income bracket. No it is two children only here and people have to think about their choice when they are not in that income bracket. That is why this Bill is fundamentally unjust.Basically this Bill proposes a poverty tax. In the previous Parliament many Government Members valiantly rebelled when it came to Budget measures on things such as the &#8220;caravan&#8221; tax and the &#8220;pasty&#8221; tax. There is no sign of any of them rebelling on the poverty tax that will hit hard-working families in their constituencies.There is no sign of any of them rebelling over the dishonest way in which this Bill treats disabled people. Yes disability premiums might be protected but not the wider benefits that people are on so disabled people will see their benefits go down as a result of these measures. They will be told &#8220;Oh no but we protected your disability premium.&#8221; That will be a fat lot of comfort when their overall income goes down as a result of these measures. There is no point in pretending to them at that stage that the tyre is only flat at the bottom; and that the comfort is in the fact that their disability premium is protected. There has been no follow through on the promises that were made to carers. Any of the promises that are still being made to carers are not reflected in this Bill.I echo the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) in saying that it is a pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Anne McLaughlin). She spoke in very moving terms and she left us in no doubt about her pride in her pedigree the purpose that she brings here on behalf of her constituents her pursuit of justice and her passion for rights and democracy. Moreover she brought humour to her case as well as honour to her cause.The 28 pages of Standing Orders that are before us constitute a confusing answer to a confused question which arises from the muddled constitutional dispensation that is the United Kingdom. In many ways this resembles the EU referendum debate. What we are witnessing is the Chamber trying to grapple with the English question. In this instance it is English votes for English laws; in other contexts it relates to the European Union. After years of struggle and failure on the Irish question and then the Scottish question we are now dealing with the English question. As the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) often says people in England now seem to believe that they are the last colony of the empire.I fully accept that this is the Conservative party&#8217;s way of trying to grapple with what it perceives to be the English question.A number of points have been made about these proposals which have been scrambled together by the Leader of the House. Last year the Government and other parties in the House told us how solemn and important the vow was but the Bill does not seem to reflect the vow. As far as I can see it is riddled with contradictions and anomalies. I do not have an inside track but I join those who wonder &#8220;How now brown vow?&#8221; How is it that when those questions are still up in the air and we do not have answers we have this fast pursuit&#8212;this scramble&#8212;on English votes for English laws?A former Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor has now that he is Leader of the House taken to political joyriding simply because he could take a vehicle for his own use and indulge himself and think he was going to show off to his peers. He thought he could take a key constitutional vehicle and purloin it for his own purpose and with speed and noise he revved people up to say &#8220;Ah here it is: English votes for English laws. Here&#8217;s the big deal.&#8221; The people who were applauding and cheering that last week are now telling us tonight &#8220;These are only minor and incidental. Why are you worrying and fretting; little will come from this?&#8221;These are of course the same people who next year&#8212;we are told this will all be reviewed next year&#8212;will tell us this mishmash has turned out to be somewhere betweena fig leaf and a figment in terms of resolving the English question and satisfying those with concerns about that. They will end up saying &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t made enough of a difference on enough votes or Bills.&#8221; Alternatively they will make it their business to try to show it can make a huge difference. That is why I am not sure that many Members on the Government Benches have fully read the Standing Orders.I am not opposed to some aspects of what is in these Standing Orders. I actually think there are some interesting new devices in terms of scrutiny of legislation and some of the possible additional stages&#8212;giving Members the power to hold Bills in check while they are uncertain about parts of them and forcing reconsideration. I like the idea of those reconsideration stages but I do not know why they should apply only to England-only legislation. That is the sort of qualitative consideration we should be building in for proper consideration in this House. I am less interested in English votes for English laws and more interested in better votes on better laws. That means improving procedures in this House. That is what we should be looking at: wholesale procedural improvement in this House.Then there are the arguments that say &#8220;There aren&#8217;t really such things as Barnett consequentials; there are no consequences.&#8221; The fact is that there are however. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) referred earlier to his time as Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland. I know from my time that we had arguments about Barnett consequentials some of them arising directly from legislative and other measures that passed in this House. That then did change the shape of spending here and that in turn changed the shape of the Barnett package&#8212;although sometimes not enough because we must not pretend it is entirely the Treasury that decides on its own whims what goes into the Barnett formula and what does and does not count. Let us not pretend that there are no consequences.I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that the Leader of the House has handled this in a model way. This and the whole issue of the foxhunting vote are examples of premature miscalculations that have then been followed by embarrassing withdrawals.Let us look at the detail. The Leader of the House tried to tell us earlier that there is no such thing as Barnett consequentials. He tried to say there is no question of Barnett consequentials arising for any piece of legislation in this House and that that issue only arises at the estimates stage of proceedings. That is errant nonsense because we constantly hear from Ministersthat amendments cannot be accepted because they have spending consequences and an impact on the public purse.Let us also recognise that the proposals will have an impact not only on Members here but on the people we represent. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) said earlier that under the new procedures all of us would vote on these measures at different stages but we will not be voting on them at the stage that counts&#8212;the actual decision time. We are told that we should be content but I think we are somehow going to find ourselves in Dermot O&#8217;Leary or Ant and Dec land where we will be told &#8220;You may be charged but your vote will not count.&#8221;That is exactly the position that we and our constituents will be in if for example there is a repeat of anything similar to the tuition fees legislation. I sat on the Bill Committee for that Education Bill and I was able to eliminate myself from large chunks of the Committee&#8217;s proceedings which dealt with England-only matters to do with education authorities and so on. However there were aspects of the Bill relating to qualifications that had direct implications for Northern Ireland and the decisions on tuition fees had serious implications for students from Northern Ireland coming to colleges here. The Bill also had direct policy and spending implications for the devolved Executive. Decisions made here will condition the choices for others.So no matter how strong we believe the devolution package to be in our regions let us not pretend that this situation does not involve unequal legislative airspace. Some of the legislation passed in this House ends up being formative and normative for the standards expected of the devolved Administrations. At times those Administrations have to conform with decisions that they would not readily have taken themselves. Sometimes that is prefigured into the Barnett formula and the spending assumptions which creates its own difficulties.There is no sign that the Leader of the House has listened to any of the questions that have been raised. We asked what would happen if there were a bit of a twilight zone surrounding what was or was not devolved? On paper for example welfare is a devolved legislative power for the Stormont Assembly but it is clear that it is a karaoke legislative power. The Treasury basically tells the Assembly &#8220;Unless you pass the legislation in the way we want we will tax your block grant. We will take money back off the Barnett formula.&#8221; This happens even though the Treasury should have other ways of policing that situation. None of those questions has been answered about what would happen in certain situations or impasses. Serious questions have also been raised about the odd language that is being used in the Scotland Bill. There is an element of dual control over some aspects of welfare in Scotland so it is not clear when measures will be seen as England-only provisions.What are we meant to do as we move from one Grand Committee to another? The suggestion from McKay was that there could be a single Grand Committee but now a bit like King Louie in &#8220;The Jungle Book&#8221; it is a case not of &#8220;Have a Grand Committee!&#8221; but of &#8220;Have two Grand Committees! Have three Grand Committees!&#8221; We now have proposals that could give us three different Grand Committees. We are also told that there will be stages of voting and that some of us will be excluded from some of them. It is not quite clear what will happen. Perhaps we will not have to leave theroom but we will be expected to avert our eyes while votes are taken and decisions made. This does not make any sense whatever.Furthermore this will involve elected Members being told that there is something sinister subversive and wrong about their having a view and an input on some issues in this Parliament while the unelected Members of the House of Lords who are free to come from anywhere in the United Kingdom&#8212;or even outside it if they are tax exiles who are registered elsewhere for tax purposes&#8212;will have the power to determine all the legislation. The Government are absolutely shameless about that. We heard tonight about English self-determination. The Conservatives are putting ermine into English self-determination.It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller). Although I do not agree with many of his points I note that&#8212;as always&#8212;he is careful to reflect what he has heard from his constituents and he makes his own particular points. It is also a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Cumbernauld Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) who made his maiden speech. He is probably the only Member who could accuse another Member of identity theft hijacking and credit theft and still comply with the rules of avoiding controversy in a maiden speech.I cannot agree with what I have heard from some Conservative Members about the Budget. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Amanda Milling) said that she was proud to support the Budget because of the moral principle that people should always be better off in work. If that is the moral standard by which we are to test the Budget then just as the hon. Member for Bedford has listened to his constituents I have listened to mine who know that as a result of the Budget they will not be better off in work&#8212;they are in work and will be worse off because of the significant changes to tax credits the overall changes and the particular changes to family size and the two-child policy.Those are people who are hard working and who meet all the tests used in the past by the Government to define hard-working families strivers and people who have made sacrifices. The region that I represent has very high unemployment and a low-pay profile&#8212;it is not as though those people choose to be in that type of employment with the pay that they receive and their dependency on tax credits. This is a wilful choice by the Chancellor: &#8220;These are the people who are to be punished. If we are going to balance the books I am picking out those who have no choice but to work for those wages and need tax credits to support themselves and their families.&#8221; That is why I oppose this Budget.In principle I support the concept of a living wage and a good working national living wage would be a good thing. The Chancellor has used the national living wage not just&#8212;supposedly&#8212;to grab the headline of increasing the minimum wage but also to try to puncture the concept of the living wage. The hon. Member for Bedford believes that the tax credit nettle had to be grasped because too many companies were abusing tax credits and paying people less than they should be paid but there are other ways to tackle that. Let us do more to force through pay transparency in companies. We have talked a lot about trying to improve tax transparency for companies large and small but we should be doing more on pay transparency as that would help to sort out those issues.Strengthening and encouraging trade unions to bring forward more pay transparency would also help. If this is about tackling corporate abuse we should do it at the level of those committing the abuse not those people who are being &#8220;exploited&#8221;&#8212;in the terms of the hon. Member for Bedford&#8212;by companies and therefore have to depend on tax credits. Removing tax credits does not remove the exploitation faced by people on low pay. It makes people walk the plank into poverty simply so that somebody can say the nettle has been grasped. That is a miserable proposition.I know that Conservative Members favour the benefits cap and placing an overall cap on what families can receive. We continue to oppose the benefits cap which as we predicted once introduced has been lowered. We are also seeing the start of regionalisation and a differentiation between London and the rest and we know that at times people have flirted with the idea of further regionalisation.As well as the benefits cap there is the welfare cap and the two are sometimes confused. The welfare cap is generally ignored but it was introduced by the Government to place a cap on the overall welfare budget across the UK. In the March Budget statement the welfare cap for 2016-17 was set to be &#163;122.3 billion but the recent Budget placed it at &#163;115.2 billion&#8212;a reduction of &#163;7 billion between March and the summer. What a difference an election makes yet the Government did not tell us they were doing that.The 2017-18 benefit cap is down by &#163;10.2 billion from &#163;124.8 billion to &#163;114.6 billion and for 2019-20 it is down by &#163;16.3 billion from &#163;129.8 billion to &#163;113.5 billion. We know that that will mean not only cuts to households or people with disabilities but cuts that hit spending power in economies such my constituency where because of high unemployment low wages and high levels of economic inactivity people are dependent on benefits. There will be a cost not only to those family economies but to the local economy as well and that is why I will oppose this Budget.I commend the hon. Member for Halifax (Holly Lynch) for initiating the debate. Like other Members I commend the Government for supporting last Friday&#8217;s resolution.Unlike the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) I do not see the report as unbalanced. Paragraph 668 states that&#8220;the commission was able to gather substantial information pointing to serious violations of international humanitarian law andinternational human rights law by Israel and by Palestinian armed groups. In some cases these violations may amount to war crimes.&#8221;That is what we should be addressing.We should also be clear that we need to move forward. Other hon. Members have rightly said that arms sales continue. In the four months following the attacks arms sales went to Israel so more has been done to replenish its arsenals which were depleted in these massive attacks than has been done to repair Gaza&#8217;s battered blasted and rubbled civic fabric. We also need to remember that the building of that civic fabric which is now damaged was supported by aid from this country and others. People have a right to defend health facilities schools and civil infrastructure which need to be protected.The state of Israel needs to recognise that people in the international community are not making an anti-Israel case. Many of us totally oppose conflict and violence. I am not one of those who tries to pretend that there is military equivalence between the violence wreaked by Hamas and the massive violence wreaked by Israel. Equally I do not pretend there is a moral difference between the violence of the two sides when it ends up killing innocent civilians and putting in dread people who should be living in peace together.Today however we have heard the pretence that Israel has the right to treat Gaza as though it is a foreign state and to attack it on the basis that Israel is under threat from another state. That is from the same Members who then tell us that we in this House do not have the right to call for Palestine to be recognised as a state. How come people can recognise Palestine as a state when they want to justify violence&#8212;for military purposes&#8212;when the rest of us are not allowed to recognise it as a state for diplomatic and political purposes and to achieve a peaceful resolution?I want to follow on from some of the issues touched on by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) particularly his last point about a financial settlement. When debating the earlier group of amendments he intervened on the Secretary of State to ask whether he would address how the Barnett formula might be adjusted.In essence I think that the right hon. Gentleman is corroborating some of the basic questions asked by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) about clauses 24 and 25 which presume an awful lot and raise a lot of questions about what else should be in them and what is happening outside them. The clauses presume a standard of behaviour and courses of action and events in relation to how decisions will be made. For instance the word &#8220;concurrently&#8221; is used but if we look at the sequence of decisions and processes involved we will see that they do not look very concurrent. There could be distended periods and a lot of dispute and difference. The most important gap in clauses 24 and 25 &#8212;both Labour and the SNP have tabled amendments to address this&#8212;is that they do not say what will happen if Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of State do not concur on some of the issues.If we as legislators are going to pass clauses that presume certain standards the course of events and political behaviour the question we need to ask is &#8220;And what if not?&#8221; The Bill does not answer that question. If there is no agreement between Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of the State on the decisions timelines details and other implications what will happen? We will be in difficulty and we will be told &#8220;Well the legislation faithfully followed Smith and we couldn&#8217;t do any more than that&#8221; but it is clear that Smith is not of itself sufficient to address those questions so we as legislators must address them. The Smith commission exercise was different from that for which we have responsibility as legislators. It is not good enough for us to say &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to answer those obvious questions because Smith didn&#8217;t address them.&#8221;I speak from the experience of having been through the Northern Ireland process during which we negotiated agreement after agreement and had lots of developments. Often the Government&#8212;by which I mean both parties&#8212;would say &#8220;We&#8217;re faithfully implementing the agreement&#8221; but it was clear and many of us said that it was not adequate for its purpose and that more needed to be done. We were of course proved right so I feel a lot of empathy for Scottish colleagues who are saying that it is not enough to say that the Bill faithfully implements Smith when it does not answer practical basic fundamental questions.It is not enough to say &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what happens&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;ll see who goes to the courts first&#8221; because that does not give a proper answer in constitutional terms. Neither would it be edifying to the public in terms of giving politics any sort of good reputation if politicians end up blaming each other for their own powerlessness or for the fact that they are delivering confusion.Again I speak from experience in Northern Ireland where as is the case with this Bill particularly clauses 24 and 25 there is an image of dual control. There is a degree of devolution but there is also a degree of control from Westminster and Whitehall. The idea is that it will all be done swimmingly and smoothly but the fact is that when that does not happen decisions are not taken and politicians of different parties say that they want to take certain decisions but cannot do so. That blame game does no credit to any of the political institutions or parties. I do not want to see the same sort of presumption being used in this Bill because it could end up creating a crisis.Not only are words such as &#8220;concurrently&#8221; used when the processes are not very concurrent; there is also the idea that the Secretary of State can give agreement and that such agreement will not be &#8220;unreasonably withheld.&#8221; Who decides what is unreasonable? Whose judgment does that rely on? What is the real motive behind that? There are different views in Northern Ireland as to who is being reasonable and who is being unreasonable.To return to the point raised by the right hon. Member for Wokingham about the financial settlement and the idea that there would have to be a test of whether it was fair to England in Northern Ireland what was supposed to be a devolved legislative decision on welfare has essentially been subject to a budget bullying exercise not by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland but by the Treasury. This Bill is silent on the issue of the Treasury so I think that an amendment will be needed on Report to address the Treasury&#8217;s role.I know that on paper the devolution of welfare to Northern Ireland is not the same as that proposed in this Bill but the lesson is salient. The karaoke legislative power that the Northern Ireland Assembly has to pass legislation is such that it has to be delivered according to the words and music passed by this House. If not the Treasury has told us &#8220;We will claw back your money&#8221; by which it means not the welfare spending but the devolved budget. The Treasury is interfering in what was meant to be the financial settlement under the Barnett formula.The right hon. Member for Wokingham asked earlier what would happen in relation to the Barnett formula. He also asked a very good question when he said heagreed with the findings of the Smith commission on devolving aspects of welfare. He pointed out that we had to ask the question: &#8220;How far does it go?&#8221; I believe that the amendments tabled by Labour and the Scottish National party are an attempt to clarify how far that devolution would go. They would make it clear from the start what paths were open to Scottish Ministers and to the Scottish Parliament. Incidentally I would have preferred to see more emphasis on the Scottish Parliament in the Bill; all the references seem to be to Scottish Ministers. But that is another issue.The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question&#8212;how far does it go?&#8212;will not be answered by clauses 24 and 25 or by the Government&#8217;s rejection of the amendments. Instead the question will have to be answered on each and every occasion that the Secretary of State is asked how far Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament can go in relation to the available discretion on welfare spending. We should not have to have that constant political checkpoint in place for the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers whereby it will fall to Ministers here to say how far the devolution of welfare should go on each separate decision. That will be recipe for permanent tension and contention. I thought that the purpose of the Smith commission and of this Bill was to ensure that we would be relieved of such contention both here and in the Scottish Parliament.The Scottish Parliament should be able to use its discretion to address the merits of the particular benefit changes and innovations that it wants to introduce. Those benefits might relate to cancer sufferers for example. There could be a specific cancer support allowance that could effectively cut through a lot of the confusion that exists in relation to other benefits such as employment and support allowance. We should let the people in the Scottish Parliament address the question of how benefits can be made to work and to deal with the real problems that people have in Scotland. They could set a good example to the rest of us. They should be empowered and emancipated to concentrate on those issues by these devolutionary measures instead of constantly having to deal with political crises and political fallout and to wonder what kind of political gamesmanship Ministers in London or in Scotland will be accused of playing in relation to a matter as fundamental as welfare.Nothing scandalises the public more than the perception that an issue as fundamental as welfare&#8212;particularly for people with disabilities and long-term conditions&#8212;has become a political football. We have seen that sense of scandal in Northern Ireland and I do not want to see it repeated anywhere else. That is why the Secretary of State needs to listen to the points raised in the amendments. This is not about political point scoring; it is about ensuring in the spirit in which this devolution is meant to be extended that the people in Scotland can address these issues and ideas without feeling that they are getting into serious political quicksand. They do not want to feel that their actions could trigger a demand for another referendum for example. We must let them put to the Scottish Parliament their own ideas for the betterment of their people without feeling that they could get into an awkward situation.That would result in the Scottish Parliament working better and in freeing this Parliament of arguments and contention that it does not need to bother itself with. It would also set a very good example to the rest of uswho need to sort out our own alignment on the devolution of welfare. I do not want to return to our own situation in Northern Ireland however. I am not saying that the proposals in this Bill should automatically be translated into a Bill for Northern Ireland. I support most of the amendments that have been tabled but I cannot pretend that all the new clauses would work in the context of or be applicable to Northern Ireland. There would obviously be differences and I do not wish to presume anything in that regard. Let us get this devolution right and let us give the Scottish Parliament the chance to get welfare right on its own terms. That would involve no risk or threat to this Parliament and it would certainly set an example to the rest of us.Following the right hon. Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) I must say that in my eyes it was new light from an old window to hear him want to escape the givens of history so readily. I would welcome that being applied in other directions.Like other Members the right hon. Gentleman rehearsed some of the strong and passionate arguments that he will bring to the debate that will take place on the back of the referendum whenever it happens. I want to touch on some of those issues but also to address the Bill and some of the questions about the quality of the referendum and what we will be afforded.Hon. Members have made the point that compared with some of the debates on Fridays during the last Parliament the Chamber looks very different. That is simply because many of us regarded the debates on the private Member&#8217;s Bill in the last Parliament as an exercise in which the ADHD wing of the Tory party was pleasuring itself and we did not wish to spectate or to participate in that exercise. We are now in a different situation as the Bill comes from the Government and other parties seem to have adjusted their view of the potential of a referendum. That done we need to ensure that we do not simply rush into pre-emptively debating the referendum but look at some of the issues in the Bill.One of the questions is whether the franchise should be extended. I fully believe that the franchise for the referendum should be extended to 16 and 17-year-olds. I openly admit that I believe that 16 and 17-year-olds should have the vote in all elections anyway. In the past I have tabled amendments to Northern Ireland legislation to give the Assembly that power in respect of its own elections and those for local government and I have voted for such an earlier franchise here.I heard the Foreign Secretary say that the question of votes for 16 and 17-year-olds was a decision &#8220;for another day&#8221;. From listening to what people are saying we are talking about a referendum on a decision for future generations so it is wrong simply to dismiss the issue as a matter for another day. As the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) said nobody is pretending that the arguments for voting at 16 and 17 are the same as those for votes for women but it is true that the arguments against doing so are invariably the same as those against votes for women&#8212;that people were immature could not make decisions of their own and would derive decisions from others.The Bill will alter the franchise for the referendum by extending it to peers. When we ask what is going to happen to votes for the young we should know that four lords named Young and even one named Younger will get votes in the referendum. That is what the Government have done in response to the question about votes for young and younger people in this referendum: five people in the House of Lords will get a vote but all the 16 and 17-year-olds are ignored.I share the important concerns raised about purdah. Once people think that there has been any jiggery-pokery on the basic rules that will create questions and causeconsternation some of which will be abused in a distorted and exaggerated way during the campaign to distract from the core arguments in the referendum. I therefore question why the Government have moved on purdah.Similarly on the questions about money I again think it is important that the Government are not seen simply to be changing the rule in relation to this referendum particularly given that there will be many questions about where a lot of it will be sourced.There is also an issue about the wording&#8212;whether it should be a yes or no question and whether it should be as advised by the Electoral Commission. I favour going the Electoral Commission way simply because of the experience in the Irish context where a very powerful argument has continually been used in referendums: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know vote no.&#8221; That has been used time out of number in the context of Irish referendums with people opposing the referendum creating all sorts of scares arguments and detailed and technical confusions that nobody can quite settle. Not even the independent Referendum Commission can fully enlighten people about what is or is not involved. That makes it very easy for people to use the argument &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know vote no.&#8221;I do believe that the Government would be well advised to change the question. We have seen this week that the Prime Minister is able to have a second take on some issues. Even when he feels that he is restating a position it seems to be somewhat different. It might be a case of &#8220;EU turn if you want to&#8221; with this Conservative leader. The Government should accede to the advice of the Electoral Commission.When the referendum takes place we need to recognise that there are many different issues for many different people. I represent a border constituency in Northern Ireland and the implications of the UK leaving the EU would be pretty fundamental not just for my constituency but for the political institutions in Northern Ireland. The common experience of EU membership provided the very context in which there were changed British and Irish relations which in turn provided the context for the peace process.It should be remembered that the institutions of the Good Friday agreement do not take as givens just the human rights provisions of the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights but the common EU membership of the UK and Ireland. Even some of the cross-border institutions that were set up as a result of the Good Friday agreement directly address and reflect our common membership of the EU. Fundamental damage and change may be done when serious questions are raised about our commitment to human rights and to our membership of the EU. If we are facing a referendum we will have to address those issues and carry forward the arguments responsibly.We must recognise that people have more questions about the sovereignty of this Parliament than just where it stands vis-&#224;-vis the European institutions. We heard that yesterday in the debate on the Scotland Bill. There are clear tensions and ambiguities around what the notion of parliamentary sovereignty means for this Parliament and around the implications for devolved institutions and the rightful authority that they should have. Similarly in terms of what comes out of any EU renegotiation there will be tensions between this Parliament&#8217;s notion of its parliamentary sovereignty and what emerges in the new arrangements and treaty terms.That is why in my view it would have been better to have had something like a constitutional convention before the referendum not only to address the longer-term democratic relations within the UK and create a new democratic charter between this Parliament and the other elected institutions in different parts of the UK but to create a new democratic charter that clearly creates a delineation between this Parliament and the various EU institutions.There is a danger that we will end up with a referendum campaign in which the yes side includes people who want to be both half in and half out and a no side that is also confused because it includes some people who want to be totally out as well as people who say that if we reject it we can be half out and renegotiate in the way that Ireland did. The danger is that we will end up with a referendum that does not settle the question at all in the terms in which Members believe it will.I rise not to make any party political points on the Budget with regard to parties formerly or currently in government but to respond to a Budget statement that was full of smuggery and spin. It seems to me that the Chancellor was claiming circumstantial credit for things such as low commodity prices and low inflation and using that context to set out a Budget stall that was very much about making an election statement. However I need to look at such a Budget and ask what the implications really are for the next spending period and for my constituency.Beyond some of the measures that the Chancellor announced not all of which I disagree with&#8212;indeed some of them no one would disagree with&#8212;it is quite clear that he has locked in further heavy cuts for the next spending period not least in welfare. I represent a constituency that is consistently ranked as having the highest level of unemployment anywhere in the UK and the problem is genuinely lack of work not lack of work ethic. It is also a border constituency. We must therefore judge the measures in the Budget and in what is promised for the next spending review courtesy of the previous autumn statement in terms of the implications for our economy and our services.It is not the case that the Budget has little to do with the circumstances in a place such as Derry because all the key service decisions are devolved. Many of those decisions are rightly devolved and I want to see more decisions made at that level but of course the spending power of the devolved Executive is determined here and of course the working circumstances for many of our businesses as well as our services are still determined by the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget statement.The hon. Member for Birmingham Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) pointed out that the Chancellor said nothing in his statement about the health service. I agree with her but actually he said very little about the public services at all and in circumstances in which he was using a degree of spin and a few wheelie turns to try to say that austerity was coming to an end earlier and that an easing was in sight. Nothing was offered to the people in key public services who have endured pay restraint after pay restraint even as their work loads have increased. As payrolls have decreased and work loads have increased the pressures on them have gone up and the rewards have gone down. With the exception of what they can find in the changes in the personal tax allowance absolutely nothing&#8212;not relief or respite&#8212;was offered to them. Instead they are being offered more of the cuts that will affect the circumstances in which they are working very hard to provide those services.It must be remembered that the private sector in Northern Ireland and certainly in my border constituency is very dependent on selling across the border and in circumstances in which our trade is affected so our retail sector and those selling services to households are losing out because with the current exchange rate trade is going across the border and people are purchasing across the border rather than locally. For those who export much of their business is in the south and obviously the continuing pressures in the eurozone and the high exchange rate affect those markets. The Budget therefore contains no great news for our publicsector on which Northern Ireland is very dependent and nothing to relieve the pressures faced by our private sector.The Chancellor referred to the Government&#8217;s moves in relation to corporation tax for Northern Ireland and the Corporation Tax (Northern Ireland) Bill which we welcome. We recognise that the Chancellor made it clear that he is committed if he is returned to that position to go on reducing the headline rate of corporation tax for the whole of the UK so the differential that we will achieve for Northern Ireland will not be as marked as it was when people first sought the devolution of corporation tax. We also know that the Government are saying that the commencement of the devolution of corporation tax in 2017 will only be on the basis that the Treasury is satisfied at that point that Northern Ireland has a balanced and sustainable budget.We see this year that the Government set out pre-conditions for the introduction of the corporation tax Bill such as that the Assembly had to deliver welfare reform measures in terms that it might have preferred not to. The question arises whether the Executive and the Assembly will similarly be told in 2017 that what will then be the corporation tax powers Act will be activated only on the basis of decisions then made such as the welfare cuts to be imposed at that time. We know that &#163;12 billion of welfare cuts are foreseen in the next spending review period so again we have to ask where that is going to leave the Executive in Northern Ireland and more importantly people in my constituency.As other Members have said it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Havard. I commend the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) on securing this debate. I suppose he is a gamekeeper turned poacher on the Backbench Business Committee. He ensured that the e-petition which gathered a significant number of signatures would be debated before the close of this Parliament.It is a pleasure to follow not only the opening speech from the hon. Gentleman but also the insights from the hon. Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris). His teasing out of where some of these issues could go are reinforced by his experience as a member of the Health Committee. It was also a pleasure to hear from the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) who talked about a particular constituency case that has given strong more than anecdotal evidence that corroborates some of the issues raised by other Members on how the NMCis having to work because of the position it is in. It is important that we consider issues relating not only to how the NMC works and whether its cost burdens should be alleviated in different ways or apportioned but to the Professional Standards Authority the funding source and scheme of which seems to be fundamental to the inequities we are discussing.Many people wonder what Parliament&#8217;s role is in all this. They think Parliament is meant to oversee the health service and strong public service ethics but it appears to wring its hands when these changes come along but everyone seems powerless to do anything. I tabled a prayer of annulment against the order that has brought about the increase in fees&#8212;early-day motion 697 if any Members want to scrabble in and sign it before Dissolution. However it is only a prayer of annulment. As the hon. Member for Easington said many people have written to MPs in all parts of the UK but they are left bemused by the responses they receive. At least now we are having this debate courtesy of the hon. Member for Blaydon. I look forward to hearing the Minister respond to it.The point has been made that those who have to register with the NMC have faced pay restraint for a number of years. They are locked into pay freezes and many are coping with the perverse and inequitable outcomes of the &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221;. That has been the case for many professionals in my constituency in Northern Ireland who have not only questioned where they are in relation to particular bands and how their responsibilities have been correlated with others but found themselves at odds with what has been decided in neighbouring health trusts.If people are already facing so many frustrations relating to their pay and conditions they are particularly aggrieved when they are hit with what is essentially a vocational tax. They are being told because that their vocation is so important and sensitive and is subject to a registration process that is open to fitness-to-practise procedures they have to pay more for the privilege of continuing to work. They are not being paid any more&#8212;they are actually being paid less&#8212;but they are having to pay more to register to turn up to work. Surely that is unfair and inequitable.The fees have gone up from &#163;76 to &#163;100 and now to &#163;120. That is just shy of a 60% increase in a small number of years and people are rightly aggrieved. If that has been the form over a couple of years they will ask whether it will be sustained&#8212;will it project into the future? There is a proper question for us to ask in Parliament and for Ministers to answer. It is not enough simply to say &#8220;Well this is the process we have. The NMC has to make the decisions and there is nothing we can do about it.&#8221; A couple of years ago because of the pressure of the number of fitness-to-practise cases the Government saw fit to use a &#163;20 million subvention to help to relieve the situation so why could not a further subvention be used? That would at least provide cover while other changes were introduced.There are questions about the PSA&#8217;s funding being sourced on a per-registrant basis which seems to line up the NMC for a particularly undue hit in terms of its source funding to the PSA. I will not go through it all again but hon. Members asked about the cost burden that will arise and the procedural length of fitness-to-practise cases. Other hon. Members asked whether there mightnow be impressionistic evidence that health service management is using fitness-to-practise cases as a crude management tool. Perhaps they allow management to abscond from some of its more subtle and intelligent responsibilities by transferring crude enforcement to someone else. The cost in such cases is clearly giving rise to what seems to be a completely disproportionate working burden on the NMC.I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point and for giving colour to the concerns we feel when we look at the number of cases the cost burden the wider impact on the NMC and the costs faced by those who have to register with the NMC. We must remember that the NMC does not only work to service its members&#8217; professional standing. It is there to safeguard not only professional standards but public assurance and the wider public interest.There is a case for asking whether anything can be done to alleviate and re-profile the NMC&#8217;s costs and whether those costs can be better shared so that they do not fall only on nurses and midwives but are spread more widely among all of us who rely on the work and good standing of the regulators of such services.A number of hon. Members mentioned the proposals in the offing that might allow some of these issues to be addressed. It is not a case of some of us just screaming against a fee increase and saying &#8220;Something should be done about it&#8221;&#8212;there have been opportunities. Reference has been made to the Law Commission&#8217;s draft Bill on the regulation of the health and social care professions. It is disappointing "},
    {"label":"Catherine McKinnell","value":"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mr Stringer. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) on securing this important debate on prosecuting corporate economic crime and on his argument which he put forward with his customary elegance. The debate is timely in the light of recent announcements by Ministers. I congratulate all the hon. Members who have taken part in the debate who made powerful contributions and set out strongly the arguments that the Government should listen to. Each of them made important points to which I shall refer. I do not mean to diminish the Minister&#8217;s presence when I say that I am disappointed that neither of the Law Officers could attend the debate. I hope that is not a sign of Government obfuscation on these important issues.Like my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock) I am not here to bash bankers. The City of London is the world&#8217;s second-largest financial centre and a major contributor to the UK economy. Its success is clearly founded on the professionalism and integrity&#8212;for the most part&#8212;of those who work in the sector. That is why we cannot allow its reputation to be undermined by the actions of the minority who engage in fraud corruption and market manipulation. Yet despite the events of 2007 and 2008 and all that has followed&#8212;parliamentary commissions Select Committee inquiries and the setting up of new regulators&#8212;economic or white-collar crime remains a serious problem in the UK. We need only look at the horrifying spectre of LIBOR rate rigging to be reminded of why the Government cannot rest on their laurels in this matter; yet the ability of our law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to tackle such pernicious crimes remains limited.As my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North pointed out the Government gave some promising signals. They announced the introduction of a senior managers regime to hold named executives to account for their actions and they pledged to introduce a new corporate offence of failure to prevent economic crime. It is disappointing that that was not as my hon. Friend pointed out etched in stone but it was in the manifesto for all to see. Both proposals were seen as vital to prevent the repetition of the failings of the past and bring the UK regime into the 21st century. However in both cases the Government have backtracked.What do we know about the reasons for the Government&#8217;s change of heart about the corporate liability offence? According to a response to a written question to the Ministry of Justice&#8220;there is little evidence of corporate economic wrongdoing going unpunished&#8221;.That is despite the fact that according to the Financial Conduct Authority banks have paid an estimated &#163;1.8 billion in compensation for mis-selling financial products such as interest rate swaps and have already set aside an additional &#163;27 billion to compensate for payment protection insurance mis-selling. That is not to mention the &#163;4.4 billion lost each year to tax evasion according to the latest estimates from Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs or the countless banks and financial institutions that are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for various types of misconduct but have not yet been prosecuted. Why have the Government concluded that no action is required? I hope that the Minister can enlighten us.Some recent disclosures are cause for concern. Last month the Treasury published the national risk assessment the first comprehensive assessment of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing&#8212;both from within the UK and flowing through it. It is the first assessment of its kind and has been highly anticipated since the Government committed themselves to producing it in their 2014 anti-corruption plan. The Government&#8217;s assessment of the risks posed by elements in the financial sector is clear:&#8220;The size and complexity of the UK financial sector mean it is more exposed to criminality than financial sectors in many other countries including abuse enabled by professional enablers in the legal and accountancy sector&#8221;.Nevertheless the report notes that the UK has &#8220;significant intelligence gaps&#8221; with respect to money laundering despite what is judged to be a serious threat from for example the legal banking and accountancy sectors. The conclusions are not encouraging:&#8220;The UK&#8217;s response is well developed but more needs to be done to ensure it is commensurate with our status as a well regulated global financial centre.&#8221;The message is clear: far more needs to be done. I would therefore welcome reassurance from the Minister that something is being done. The aim must be to ensure that the appropriate measures are in place to deter behaviour that facilitates or contributes to the committing of economic crime. That would not only encourage good practice and the right corporate culture but mean that wrongdoers were held accountable which would be a deterrent. There is widespread concern that the UK&#8217;s current corporate liability regime is not up to the job. That is the view of the Law Commission and the OECD&#8217;s working group on bribery both of which have produced seminal work on the subject. Both concluded that the current regime does not allow the UK to hold corporations and key persons within them to account effectively for their part in economic crimes.In its extensive work on the UK&#8217;s corporate liability measures the Law Commission described the present regime as&#8220;an inappropriate and ineffective method of establishing criminal liability of corporations&#8221;.It also noted the unfairness inherent in the identification doctrine explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North which makes it far easier to prosecute smaller companies where the &#8220;directing mind&#8221; is more easily determined than large corporations with much more diffuse chains of command.My hon. Friend makes an important point that goes to the heart of the argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon argued cogently that ultimately we need a better way of establishing responsibility for the actions of a company and those who serve within it. It is not enough for those at the top to wash their hands of responsibility for the actions of the officers and employees who operate act and work under the company&#8217;s name.There needs to be much greater clarity about the legal framework. Many bodies including the Law Commission have called for that. What is even more key is that theGovernment seem to share that view. In a consultation undertaken in July 2015 on the introduction of a new corporate offence of failure to prevent tax evasion the Government concluded:&#8220;Under the existing law it can be extremely difficult to hold the corporations to account for the criminal actions of their agents&#8221;.That observation has been made by the Government and Ministers on several occasions as well as by my hon. Friends in their contributions today.The Law Commission the OECD working group and the director of the Serious Fraud Office point to section 7 of Labour&#8217;s Bribery Act as a potential solution. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North set out in his speech section 7 of the Bribery Act makes it an offence to fail to prevent bribery. It places the onus on companies to prove that they have put in place adequate procedures to prevent bribery and is widely seen as a far more effective way of holding companies and the individuals within them to account which is why many want to see that model extended to other types of economic crime.My hon. Friend makes an important point and anticipates my next point. First I want to clarify exactly where the Government seem to be on this issue.The Government&#8217;s recent announcement has caused much confusion among those who care about this issue because it seems to be very much at odds with what they have been saying and the messages and signals they have been sending out. In his first speech as Attorney General over a year ago the right hon. and learned Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright) suggested that he was considering the section 7 proposal. We then discovered in an answer to a written parliamentary question that it had been dropped. We need clarity from the Minister today about exactly why that decision was made and what the Government will do to ensure that our concerns are addressed if they are not proceeding with that proposal.The director of the Serious Fraud Office David Green has made clear his support for the expansion of section 7 of the Bribery Act. He has described how useful it would be in order to better facilitate the use of deferred prosecution agreements. My hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Christina Rees) set out eloquently how deferred prosecution agreements work and their potential importance in dealing with some of the issues that have been highlighted. It is no secret that the Serious Fraud Office director favours the use of DPAs which are currently more widely used in the United States. To clarify they provide for a corporation to avoid prosecution by entering into an agreement with a number of conditions attached which may include paying a financial penalty paying compensation or co-operating with future prosecutions of individuals. In doing so they avoid prosecution. The aim is to hold key individuals to account to secure significant financial penalties from companies that have committed wrongdoing and ultimately to prevent future wrongdoing by encouraging or mandating reforms within those companies.Deferred prosecution agreements are not without their critics but they have been widely used in the US for the past 20 years or so and brought in some $4.2 billion to the Department of Justice in 2014 alone. One key problem with importing the use of DPAs to the UK is that they are intended to be a carrot while the stick is the prospect of prosecution for corporate economic offences.My hon. Friend makes an important point. We should not shy away from learning lessons from any jurisdiction that manages to control risk as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon highlighted and to hold companies to account where wrongdoing has occurred. Where there are lessons to be learned from the US we should learn them and do what we can to implement them within our own system. We could then hold ourselves up as a beacon for other countries and hold our heads high as a well-regulated world-leading financial centre. That has to be our aim in all of this.As my hon. Friend the Member for Neath pointed out without the fear of corporate economic crime being prosecuted there is little incentive for companies to enter deferred prosecution agreements and no incentive for companies to co-operate with the SFO to change their practices as mandated under a DPA. Unlike in the US which has far stronger vicarious liability laws there are still far too few corporate prosecutions in the UK under the current identification principle. No matter how much we may wish to learn from the United States&#8212;if that is what we see as the right way forward&#8212;without a strengthened corporate liability regime we will be hampered in our efforts to implement such changes.Finally I turn to another area that shows concerning signs of backtracking by the Government and in which we would otherwise have seen individuals in companies held accountable for their own and others&#8217; actions. In its 2013 report on the banking sector and how to prevent the failings that led to the 2008 crash theParliamentary Commission on Banking Standards similarly recognised the difficulty in identifying individuals and holding them to account. One of its key recommendations was to introduce a senior managers regime to hold named executives personally responsible for key risks in the bank. That issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon who made a powerful speech about encouraging better and more responsible management within companies in order to change bad practice where it is found. The commission recommended that the regime place a burden of proof on those named executives who would have to show the regulator that they had done all they reasonably could to prevent failings or misconduct if they were to avoid sanction.My hon. Friend raises a concern relating to the Bribery Act but there are two ways of looking at the Act&#8217;s implementation and the fact that no prosecutions have yet happened under it. There is evidence that it has already brought about significant changes in corporate culture and that the managers tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that they have taken all the steps they could reasonably be expected to have taken to prevent bribery in their organisations have taken those steps. Some positives can therefore certainly be derived from the situation but I agree that a very close eye needs to be kept on prosecutions. I note that there are already murmurings from the Government about backtracking on the Bribery Act and trying to weaken that legislation and we must stay vigilant about that.On the senior managers regime the Commission recommended that the regime place a burden of proof on those named executives. The recommendation was accepted by the Government and enshrined in the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013. However the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill which is currently in the other place is set to reverse that burden of proof meaning that instead the regulator&#8212;the Financial Conduct Authority&#8212;will be required to prove that senior managers have failed in their duty to prevent misconduct or prudential failings. The onus will be back on the regulator and not on the named senior executives. Is that just more backtracking from the Government who seem to be going soft on economic crime? I would be grateful if the Minister provided reassurance that that is not the case.Ministers urgently need to look again at their approach to tackling economic crime because without change the prospect of ensuring that justice is served to those who have mis-sold financial products evaded tax laundered money and defrauded seems as remote as ever and the risk of the scandals of recent years being repeated has far from disappeared.It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship Mrs Main and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central (Jo Stevens) on securing this afternoon&#8217;s extremely important debate on behalf of her constituent Mr Kashif Shabir and the constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) Mr Alun Richards. This is my first outing in the role of shadow Attorney General which I am pleased to be taking on in particular in a shadow Cabinet that for the first time has a majority of women. I am thoroughly looking forward to holding the Attorney General and the Solicitor General&#8217;s feet to the fire but also working constructively with them when appropriate.As with all Serious Fraud Office cases those of Mr Richards and Mr Shabir are complex but they have been carefully and passionately set out by my hon. Friends. There is much to be passionate about. As many of us know from our constituency postbags and surgeries there are many more cases such as those we have heard about today throughout the country. Since the financial crisis small medium and even large firms have been brought to their knees by the banking system with serious allegations of malpractice being made. Good and credible businesspeople such as Mr Richards and Mr Shabir have seen their credit ratings destroyed after having worked hard for years and decades to build up their businesses. We only need to look at the Bully Banks campaign to see just how many firms and individuals have been affected by allegations of malpractice over the past few years.Indeed I have a constituency case involving the now acknowledged mis-selling of interest rate hedging products or swaps; my constituent&#8217;s family and the many who rely on them for good skilled employment have been reeling from the consequences of that ever since. We are not discussing the swap mis-selling scandal today but the activities alleged by Mr Richards and Mr Shabir and the consequences of those activities bear a striking resemblance to the situation suffered by my constituent. I have a real fear that that indicates a systemic failure in our banking system across the country.As my hon. Friends for Cardiff Central and for Ogmore have explained the cases of Mr Richards and Mr Shabir involve allegations of the deliberate under- valuing by Lloyds of their properties&#8212;known as down valuation&#8212;in order to put them in breach of their loan-to-value ratios on secured debts and thereby engineer defaults on their loans. That in itself is an extremely serious allegation. I believe it has been rejected by Lloyds but was covered in some detail by the 2013 Tomlinson report commissioned by the Business Secretary in the coalition Government Dr Vince Cable. In his report into banks&#8217; lending practices and treatment of businesses in distress Lawrence Tomlinson commented:&#8220;This has been one of the most common complaints in the evidence received for this report. Revaluation of assets appears to be used on frequent occasions to put businesses into default of their loan agreements.&#8221;He went on:&#8220;Many businesses have submitted evidence demonstrating what appear to be unquestionable under-valuations of properties. They are so stark compared to original and current values of theproperty that their accuracy has to be called into question as well as the reason behind such an inaccuracy.&#8221;The report concluded&#8212;and this is the crux of the matter particularly in the cases we are considering:&#8220;Not only is the undervaluation itself a concern so is the relationship between the bank and the valuers. Often much of a valuer&#8217;s work will come from the banks and there is therefore an inherent conflict of interest as there is a natural incentive for the valuer to act in the interest of the bank.&#8221;In March the Business Innovation and Skills Committee took evidence as part of its inquiry into the insolvency industry. Witnesses conceded that it is becoming more common for property receivers to be seconded to banks. Sometimes even surveyors and receivers have been known to be seconded within lenders&#8217; restructuring divisions therefore working on lenders&#8217; distressed loans books. As even the industry witnesses to that inquiry conceded in such a situation there is potential for a serious conflict of interest.In both the cases we have heard about this afternoon Lloyds bank utilised Alder King LLP for its property valuations. Yet Alder King also had staff seconded to Lloyds working within the bank&#8217;s recoveries department&#8212;the very department that was responsible for receivership appointments. As reported by both the Financial Times and The Times such staff were engaged directly in work on the cases of Mr Shabir and Mr Richards but allegedly gave the impression that they worked directly for the bank not Alder King LLP the firm that was to benefit financially from the businesses going into receivership. It is that alleged conflict of interest and its very significant consequences about which Mr Shabir and Mr Richards have lodged their complaints to the Serious Fraud Office.As we have heard as no response had been received from Lloyds to the complaints since September 2011 Mr Shabir&#8217;s and Mr Richards&#8217;s cases were referred to the SFO in September 2013. Two meetings were held with the SFO during which a substantial amount of evidence was provided to corroborate the allegations but it was not until 7 November 2014 that the SFO&#8217;s director David Green QC responded and acknowledged the gravity of the issues raised. I understand that nothing has been heard from the SFO since some 10 months on from that communication.Of course Mr Shabir and Mr Richards are not the only ones making such allegations about the activities of Lloyds bank and Alder King. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central mentioned earlier when my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) was shadow Attorney General she wrote to the SFO director about this issue on behalf of two other Labour Members of Parliament and their constituents. In his response also dated 7 November 2014 David Green stated:&#8220;I can assure you that we are taking appropriate steps to pursue this serious issue.&#8221;Like my hon. Friends the Member for Cardiff Central and for Ogmore I look forward to receiving an update from the Solicitor General&#8212;or subsequent to the debate in writing from the Attorney General&#8212;on the actual progress that has been made in investigating these serious allegations. We all appreciate their complexity but it is now two years since the matter was first referred to the SFO.There is also clearly a significant public interest in the matter not least because we are after all discussing a bank that was bailed out by the British taxpayer and remains part-owned by the public purse. In addition since 2010 the Serious Fraud Office&#8217;s funding has been cut by just over 12% with potential serious implications for its ability to prosecute serious and complex cases of fraud and bribery effectively and in a timely manner.In the light of what we have heard this afternoon hon. Members need urgent reassurances from the Government Law Officers that the SFO does in fact have the resources it needs to investigate such cases. That question is even more pressing given the further &#163;20 billion of cuts to public spending anticipated at the forthcoming spending review with the Chancellor reportedly requiring Departments to model budget cuts of up to 40% by 2019-20.Although allegations such as those made by Mr Richards and Mr Shabir may make for uncomfortable listening for the Government it is deeply concerning that every time the Serious Fraud Office wants to take on a major case&#8212;LIBOR rigging being a prime example&#8212;it now has to effectively go cap in hand to the Treasury to apply for additional funding sometimes referred to as blockbuster funding in order to do the job. That clearly has implications for the vital independence of the SFO as the Chancellor of the Exchequer potentially has a veto on what is investigated. Indeed Transparency International has stated its concern about that situation:&#8220;The process for additional budget approval may present a substantial risk of political influence.&#8221;Again I would appreciate an assurance from the Solicitor General that there is no need for such concerns in particular with regard to the case we are discussing.During questions to the Attorney General in July the Solicitor General stated:&#8220;It is important that we give our full-throated support to the work of the SFO because as the hon. Gentleman says if there are doubts about the integrity and efficacy of that important arm of the prosecutorial authorities we are in serious trouble indeed.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report 2 July 2015; Vol. 597 c. 1611.]I could not agree more but when we hear of cases like those of Mr Shabir and Mr Richards who&#8212;like many thousands of businesses across the country&#8212;appear to have been badly let down by the system such statements are understandably thrown into doubt. We need to know that the Serious Fraud Office does not just take such matters seriously but has the will capacity and resources to investigate and then prosecute where appropriate. I look forward to hearing the Solicitor General&#8217;s reassurances in that regard.I sincerely thank you Mr Speaker for calling me to speak in this debate on what I believe will be one of the defining issues of this Parliament. I commend the hon. Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) for his excellent maiden speech. I can assure him that I have recently been using Avent bottles for my newborn baby but I must confess that we are a Tommee Tippee household.I remember my maiden speech five years ago which focused heavily on regional development a subject to which we return once again today. For cities like Newcastle and regions like the north-east the way in which we devolve meaningful powers and real funding from Whitehall to local areas is absolutely key to better supporting and funding private sector growth and creating skilled sustainable jobs. While our region has so much to offer the UK we still have the highest regional unemployment levels and the highest number of young people out of work. It is little wonder that far too many of our young people still sadly feel they need to leave Newcastle and our region to fulfil their potential despite the opportunitiesthey should have. That is one of the things that drove me to stand for Parliament back in 2010 to ensure that children in my part of the world and indeed my own children&#8212;I now have a third since I last spoke in this Chamber&#8212;have the same opportunities as children in any other part of the country. As the North East Chamber of Commerce emphasised:&#8220;Whitehall has shown itself to be incapable of delivering an approach&#160;that benefits the whole county and that is why we must ensure the North&#160;East has the chance to make those decisions for itself.&#8221;That view is clearly shared by local people. When the Chronicle asked readers about general election policy they said that their No. 1 priority was more devolved spending.What is the Government&#8217;s response to that pressing call for change? We have heard many warm words from the Chancellor about a northern powerhouse but we are yet to find out whether it means anything at all for north-east England. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government the hon. Member for Stockton South (James Wharton) is the Minister for Local Growth and the Northern Powerhouse to give him his full title and I hope he will be able to convince the Chancellor that the north of England extends north of the Pennines.The Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill was announced in last week&#8217;s Gracious Speech and its headline measure is to&#8220;devolve powers and budgets to boost local growth in England&#8221;but&#8212;and it is a pretty hefty but&#8212;only for those cities that agree to have a directly elected so-called metro mayor. Indeed the Chancellor set out how deadly serious he is about this condition in a speech in Manchester last month saying:&#8220;So with these new powers for cities must come new city-wide elected mayors who work with local councils. I will not impose this model on anyone. But nor will I settle for less.&#8221;He is clearly ignoring the 68% of voters in Newcastle who voted against a mayor only three years ago. That is an interesting take on localism by centrally mandated diktat. We will be allowed to find a mayoral model that works for us but only as long as it involves&#8220;a city-wide elected executive mayor.&#8221;The famous Henry Ford phrase&#8220;You can have any colour as long as it&#8217;s black&#8221;springs to mind.Given the Government&#8217;s determination on this issue it would be really helpful if the Minister set out how he sees it working for the north-east. The Chancellor talks of devolving power to cities but does he mean cities or areas covered by local enterprise partnerships? He goes on to describe city-wide directly elected mayors but how would that operate in the North East LEP area which has three cities&#8212;Newcastle Sunderland and Durham&#8212;as well as the conurbations of Gateshead North Tyneside and South Tyneside? The Chancellor frequently refers to metro mayors but how does that proposal apply to those other areas that the North East LEP encompasses&#8212;Northumberland and County Durham &#8212;which include some of the most rural and sparsely populated parts of England? Some clarity is needed on those issues and it is needed quick.Meanwhile in a development that appears to have slipped under many people&#8217;s radars the Government have agreed to remove a significant amount of power from regions in the very policy area under consideration. Like many other parts of the UK the north-east benefits significantly from European Union money through the European regional development fund and the European social fund. However until very recently we faced the prospect of losing &#163;724 million because the coalition removed regional development agencies without ensuring that something was put in their place. Hundreds and millions of pounds of funding intended to address unemployment support business growth and provide training in the north-east were put in jeopardy because the LEPs lacked the appropriate powers resources and accountability necessary to unlock that funding. Instead in order to prevent further hold-ups it was agreed by the Government that while LEPs will now have an advisory role the actual decisions on how that money will be spent will have to be taken in Whitehall. That is a complete contradiction of the idea of decentralisation and empowering local areas.Of course that is set against the backdrop of massive cuts to local government which I spoke about at length in the previous Parliament and I will continue to do so in this Parliament. Who are these powers for? They are for the communities and people we represent who risk being so hollowed out by the cuts to local government funding that even if they have those powers they will not be able to deliver on them.I congratulate the hon. Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker) on his thoughtful and thorough opening speech as well as my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) on his remarks. In their absence I also congratulate the hon. Members for Brighton Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) and for Clacton (Douglas Carswell) on securing today&#8217;s important debate.This debate follows a significant campaign by Positive Money which has raised important issues about how we ensure financial stability and how we as parliamentarians and members of the public can gain a greater understanding of the way our economy works in particular how money is supplied not just in this country but around the world.Some important questions have been highlighted in the debate although not all have been answered. There are questions about how money is created how money or credit is used by banks and others how our financial system can be more transparent and accountable and particularly how it can benefit the country as a whole. That latter point is something that Labour Members have been acutely focused on. How do we re-work our economy whether in banking or in relation to jobs and wages so that it works for the country as a whole?It is worth reflecting on our current system and what it means for money creation. As the hon. Member for Wycombe set out eloquently in his opening speech we know that currency is created in the conventional sense of being printed by the Bank of England but commercial banks can create money through account holders depositing money in their accounts or by issuing loans to borrowers. That obviously increases the amount of money available to borrowers and within the wider economy. As the Bank of England made clear in an article accompanying its first quarterly bulletin in 2014:&#8220;When a bank makes a loan to one of its customers it simply credits the customer&#8217;s account with a higher deposit balance. At that instant new money is created.&#8221;Bank loans and deposits are essentially IOUs from banks and therefore a form of money creation.Commercial banks do not have unlimited ability to create money and monetary policy financial stability and regulation all influence the amount of money they can create. In that sense banks are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority part of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. Those regulators some of which are&#8212;rightly&#8212;independent are the stewards of &#8220;safety and soundness&#8221; in financial institutions especially regarding banks&#8217; money-creating practices.Banks are compelled to manage the liabilities on their balance sheets to ensure that they have capital and longer-term liabilities precisely to mitigate risks and prevent them from effectively having a licence to print money. Banks must adhere to a leverage ratio&#8212;the limit on their balance sheets compared with the actual equity or capital they hold&#8212;and we strongly support that. Limiting a bank&#8217;s balance sheet limits the amount of money it can create through lending or deposits. There are a series of checks and balances in place when it comes to creating money some of which the Opposition strongly supported when we debated legislative changes in recent years. It remains our view that the central issue the instability of money supply within the banking system is less to do with the powers banks hold and how they create money than with how they conduct themselves and whether they act in the public interest in other ways too.We believe the issues relate to the incentives in place for banks to ensure that loans and debts are repaid and granted only when there is a strong likelihood of repayment. When the money supply increases rapidly with no certainty of repayment that is when real risks emerge in the economy. Those issues were debated at great length when the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 made its way through Parliament following recommendations from Sir John Vickers&#8217; Independent Commission on Banking and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards which considered professional standards and culture in the industry. The 2013 Act created the Prudential Regulation Authority and gives regulators the power to split up banks to safeguard their future to name just two examples of changes that were made. However we feel that it did not go far enough.The Opposition&#8217;s concern is that the Government&#8217;s actions to date in this area have fallen short of the mark. They have failed to boost sufficient competition in the banking industry to raise those standards and to create public confidence in the sector. As hon. Members with an interest in this area know we tabled a number of amendments to try to strengthen the Bill and to prevent banks from overreaching themselves and taking greater risks by ensuring that the leverage ratio is effective. That goes to the heart of many of the issues we are debating today. The Government rejected our proposals to impose on all those working in the banking industry a duty of care to customers. That would help to reform banking so that it works in the interests of customers and the economy and not solely those of the banks. Those are the areas on which we still feel that reform is needed in the sector.It is clear from this debate that there is a whole range of issues to consider but our focus is that the banks need to be tightly and correctly regulated to ensure that they work for the whole economy including individualsand small and large businesses. That is the key issue that we face at present. Only when the banks operate in that way and work in the interests of the whole economy will we find our way out of the cost of living crisis that so many people are facing.I thank hon. Members for securing this very important debate and for the very interesting contributions that have been made from all sides of the House. I am pretty certain that this is not the end of the conversation. The debate will go on.Any new investment in child care&#8212;particularly support for struggling families up and down the country who are battling to juggle theirwork and family lives&#8212;is clearly welcome. The Bill is therefore important but it is long overdue for thousands of parents.Fundamentally we remain concerned that the Bill will simply not address the situation in which too many parents have been left. The evidence is now overwhelming. The cumulative changes to tax and benefits over the Government&#8217;s time in office have hit families hardest as is clearly shown by new research published today. From our analysis of official statistics we know that some families in which both parents are in work will be &#163;2000 a year worse off on average by the next election as a direct result of the Government&#8217;s tax and benefits choices. Researchers from the London School of Economics and the university of Essex have released findings showing that the clear losers under the Government are lone-parent families large families and children.This summer the Prime Minister announced that all Government policies have to pass a families test. It is interesting that that is his aspiration only now because it is abundantly clear that the Government have completely failed the families test to date. We share the widely expressed concern that the Bill will not go anything like far enough to make up the shortfall that families face partly because of the tax and benefits changes but also because of soaring child care costs.Aside from that central issue we have several other concerns. We are worried that parents will be left exposed to inflated child care prices as my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) clearly set out in her speech on new clause 2. The Government have only one chance to get the hugely important IT infrastructure right but crucially there is huge concern that parents might face a nightmare of complexity and confusion if the Government fail to provide adequate support and information to help them to make informed choices and to navigate between the schemes for universal credit and for the top-up payments.Welcome though the support is for far too many parents it will be far too little far too late. I hope that the Minister has taken on board the concerns we raised throughout the proceedings in Committee and on Report whether on some of the more technical aspects of the Bill&#8217;s operation or on the more fundamental issues.My hon. Friend has herself made the point very powerfully. I was concerned when the Minister spoke at length about child poverty because the Bill will do very little to deal with such issues and we know that such figures will only increase. Levels of child poverty have increased significantly under this Government as the facts and evidence prove.Although we should focus on what the Bill will achieve&#8212;it will provide support in meeting demand for some payments for child care&#8212;my hon. Friend clearly sets out which parents will benefit most from the support.However even those parents are concerned that the scheme might unduly complicate their lives. It might be burdensome for parents to navigate it particularly those at the lower end of the income scale who have to navigate between a reduction in universal credit support and a movement into the top-up payments scheme where potentially disastrous child care support pitfalls await them. We discussed that at length in Committee and we have put our concerns on the record. Other Opposition Members and I very much hope that the Minister has taken all such concerns on board and can deliver on the reassurances that she has given.Let me take this last opportunity to urge the Government to recognise the value to parents not only of this support with child care costs but of the extension of the free entitlement to three and four-year-olds. Quite simply that would ensure that working parents are better off. It would help more parents to get back into work or to work more hours and it would help to bring home more pay for the hours they work. We know that so many parents are desperate for such support. It would be simple and effective and it would not place any more burdens on parents than those they already face. It would not add any more complexity to a child care market that is already hugely complicated.Parents have struggled for four years under this Government with a child care crunch of rising prices alongside stagnant wages. Although we will support the Bill tonight I urge the Minister to ensure that she her officials and her partners who deliver the scheme fulfil the promises that have been made during its passage in Committee so that parents can receive this much needed support.I look forward to the arrival in 2015 of a Labour Government who will ensure that parents receive not only the support provided in the Bill but an additional 10 hours of free child care for three and four-year-olds. That will deal with many of the supply-side and price inflation concerns and it will also provide child care support for the parents who will not benefit at all from the scheme."},
    {"label":"Ian Paisley Jnr","value":"I, too, thank the Secretary of State for her statement and for the very kind tribute that she paid to our party leader. I echo the thanks and gratitude to the Secretary of State and her team, for I know the very long hours that she personally has put into dealing with the situation in Northern Ireland. There will, of course, be some nay-sayers in Northern Ireland about this deal, but will the Secretary of State go as far as to say that this is by far the very best welfare deal that anyone in the United Kingdom could have? We know that there will be some people who hate the deal so much that they will be on their knees tonight in Northern Ireland praying that Scotland comes up with a slightly better deal so that they do not have to welcome it, but over 105,000 low-paid families in Northern Ireland will today be grateful that their tax credits will not be cut in the way that they would have been under another deal or under direct rule.On national security, will the Secretary of State confirm that there is no change whatever to the national security portfolio and arrangements? Although there is &#163;160 million available to assist the police in dealing with the dissident and Irish terror threat, if ISIS uses our border as a soft way into the United Kingdom, can the right hon. Lady confirm that additional resources will come from the national budget to assist with that?Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this important debate about jobs in my constituency of North Antrim.Tuesday 3 November was a sad day that will be remembered by up to 1,000 people in the Ballymena area. The Michelin factory, which is one of the few public limited companies in Northern Ireland, has produced tyres in my constituency since 1969, and the news that it was to close broke on 3 November. The 860 directly employed workers&#8212;dedicated manufacturing staff&#8212;learned of their fate that day. More than 500 other people who are indirectly associated with the factory are also affected by that apocalyptic news.I want to put the issue in context. If my constituency happened to be called Northampton rather than North Antrim, or if Ballymena were called Birmingham, we would be talking about the loss of 30,000 jobs. That is the job loss equivalent. It is important to put the announcement in its national context. That is why I welcome the fact that it is the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise, not a Northern Ireland Office Minister, who will respond to the debate. I would, of course, have welcomed a Northern Ireland Minister to the Dispatch Box, but it is important to view the job losses in their national context.A few weeks ago I expressed concern that Northern Ireland was in danger of being viewed by this House as a place apart. Our Province&#8217;s peculiar employment issues are sometimes regarded as unrelated to the national picture and national politics.Many of the employees of the Michelin plant in Ballymena hail from East Antrim. My hon. Friend has put his finger on one of the key issues, which I hope to return to in a little more detail during the course of my speech. He has identified one of the key reasons why this issue is of national importance and has to be addressed nationally. It would be very easy to say that it is a matter for the devolved Administration and that they should sort it out, but this matter is beyond their reach. It would be a mistake to think that our employment policies are a place apart. They are of national importance.A year ago, the loss of 1,000 jobs in another factory in my constituency was announced. In the wake of the two announcements&#8212;and, indeed, of the Caterpillar announcement in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency&#8212;several hundred jobs are being lost year in, year out in the manufacturing sector. That is why I described the announcement by Michelin on 3 November as apocalyptic not just for my constituency, but for the Northern Ireland manufacturing sector.Before the closures, my constituency boasted of plus 20% of Northern Ireland&#8217;s total manufacturing jobs, but come 2018, when the factories close, it will be sub 20%. That will have a devastating impact on local employment, local confidence, local spend, local schools, local businesses all around the district. By 2018, more than &#163;100 million of wages will have been taken out of my local economy, meaning that &#163;100 million will no longer be spent in local shops and the local community. The local economy is renowned for its thriftiness and the local community is renowned for being very proud of its work ethic, but those huge pillars of employment have been slowly but surely knocked down. That will have an impact on confidence, and the Minister does not require me to spell out the effect of that on a community or the impact of such a loss.That gives me the opportunity, on the back of the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), to pay tribute to Unite the union for the great work it has done in my constituency. I have had regular meetings with Unite over the years since I became a Member of Parliament, and I have a very good working relationship with it. It is dedicated to ensuring that manufacturing is maintained there, which is why it has been incredibly flexible about the workforce agreeing to reduced hours over the years. It has been very helpful about working conditions that people would not normally tolerate: it has been prepared to work with companies and help them to bring working conditions up to a standard in their own time through investment on their own terms. It has been incredibly helpful, so this gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to the unions with which I have worked both on this factory closure and on other serious issues. In fact, what has been very helpful has been the sense of warmth&#8212;it is hard to find another word for it&#8212;felt by some of the employees from their union actually standing up for them, and coming out and saying, &#8220;Look, how can we help? How can we embrace this situation and try to address some of the key issues?&#8221;Another organisation that also stands out for praise, particularly with Michelin, is the Prince&#8217;s Trust. It has already made itself available to all the employees in the factory concerned. It has identified 80 people between the ages of 18 and 30 who were probably looking forward to a lifetime career of making tyres in the factory for the next 40 years, as their fathers did before them, but are now expecting not to have a manufacturing job. The Prince&#8217;s Trust, along with the unions, has been very useful in trying to say: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can find a way of helping these young people become entrepreneurs and to find new jobs in the years ahead.&#8221;That is a very helpful intervention because it allows me to put on the record that the first thing I raised with the employer when the announcement was brought to my attention was, &#8220;How are you going to look after the workers that have made you billions of pounds as an international company over the years?&#8221; I am pleased that Michelin put into its statement on 3 November a commitment that the support from the factory will include enhanced redundancy payments and a retraining package, as well as the deployment of what is called the Michelin development community fund. I have managed to help to secure an additional &#163;5 million for my constituency, which will allow for the retraining of people and will help them to set up local businesses. That fund has been used over the years to create an additional 400 jobs that are not associated directly with Michelin. I hope that the deployment of that fund over the next 10 years will see job opportunities slowly created for these people, who would otherwise be told that they do not have a job.It must be stressed that Michelin will make job offers to those who feel able to travel to Dundee or Stoke on the mainland, although those jobs will not be in the manufacturing of large truck tyres, which is what we have done in Ballymena. I imagine that very few people will do that, but at least those job offers will be made.I thank my hon. Friend, who shares my passion for the North Antrim constituency, given her roots in County Antrim. She will have been contacted by friends and family who have been affected by the closure. I appreciate the support and encouragement she regularly gives me to continue to fight for the interests of my constituents.Michelin has identified three key reasons why it has to close the factory, and they are sad reasons. As I have said, I am glad that the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise is here and that the Government see that there is something that they can do for us nationally. The Michelin statement put three key reasons into the public domain.The first reason was as follows:&#8220;The proposal to run down the truck tyre factory in Ballymena has been made in the light of the significant downturn in demand for truck tyres in Europe since the financial crisis of 2007&#8221;.That is beyond the control of anyone on these Benches. It is a fact of life that there has been an economic downturn. For 20 years, the factory in Ballymena made truck tyres for the north American market. That market was taken from it through an internal decision by Michelin and those truck tyres have since been made elsewhere in the Michelin portfolio. After losing that market, Ballymena was solely making truck tyres for Europe. The downturn then hit us with a vengeance and we are reaping the consequences. The demand for truck tyres has decreased by more than 5 million tyres a year. That has had a catastrophic effect on the business.The second reason Michelin put into the public domain was&#8220;the huge influx of tyres made in Asia, which have doubled in the last few years, and increased competition.&#8221;Most of those have been made in Korea. The workers in my constituency never feared competition or the need to be competitive. They believed in the quality of their product, which was of award standard. However, when a cheap tyre comes in during an economic downturn, it has a devastating effect on business.The third reason was that the tyre building machines at Ballymena were not capable of making the new standard of tyres. An investment of at least &#163;50 million was needed to reappoint the factory. The company had to decide whether to make that investment or cut off the Northern Ireland arm and move everything to the mainland. That goes to the heart of the point that my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim made. Energy costs are so astoundingly high in Northern Ireland that they forced the hand of the company when making that decision. I will come on to energy costs in a moment.The Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) said that if this had happened in any other part of the United Kingdom, there would be huge interest. I welcome the fact that there are 16 Members in the Chamber for this debate. I salute every one of them for being interested enough to turn up. Usually when we come to the Adjournment debate, apart from my hon. Friend the Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), no other MP makes a contribution. I know that, at times, the Minister feels as if she is being stalked by the hon. Gentleman. I pay tribute to the fact that there is wide interest in this debate, and I am delighted that the hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound), who has visited my constituency, is also here.I want to be gentle in the way I respond to that. It would be easy to stand here and blame people. I could blame the local Minister, Invest Northern Ireland and everyone else but ourselves, but that is the coward&#8217;s way out, and we must make that clear. That is not the response that employees in Ballymena, North Antrim, South Antrim and East Antrim need. My constituents will not be bought off with the cheap excuse that this is someone else&#8217;s fault. They are intelligent people who understand the word &#8220;market&#8221;.In the last year, my constituents have witnessed a Goodyear tyre factory close on mainland Britain, and they know the pressure that the industry was under. At one point they were reduced almost to a three-day week. This was not a shock; what was shocking was the fact that eventually the decision was made on the day it was made, but there was a lot leading up to that decision. What people want now is a comprehensive strategic response to get things moving again, and it is important that we hear that from the Minister.The hon. Member for South Antrim (Danny Kinahan) made a number of points that it is important to address. The key issue behind why this factory has been under so much pressure is electricity prices in Northern Ireland&#8212;the underlying issue is energy costs. To give one stark statistic, it is 15% more costly to manufacture in Northern Ireland because our electricity costs are 15% higher. That point has been made to me over and over again, and it has driven the issue home.The hon. Gentleman asks why this closure was such a shock and whether discussions were going on. I have an email that was sent to me in 2013 from the then Ballymena plant manager, Wilton Crawford. I raised this issue with him, and he said that the&#8220;No.1 cost threat to our long-term sustainability&#8221;for manufacturing in Ballymena was electricity prices. That issue must be urgently addressed.In 2013, with that point in mind, I wrote to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister about this issue. I said that I feared not only for the future of this company in my constituency but for other large energy users if we cannot get a national policy to resolve the problem. This issue has been identified time and again&#8212;including in 2013, half way through the last Parliament.The cost differentials are staggering. In 2013, I wrote to the then Minister in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, my colleague Arlene Foster, and I said that the changes that Michelin was being asked for would increase its electricity costs by 44%&#8212;that is a 44% increase due to the new charges mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim.The Minister was brilliant in her response. By that point, Michelin was already paying &#163;1.2 million a year to its electricity provider. The climate change levy would have seen an increase of &#163;350,000 on top of that, but the Northern Ireland Government were able to hold off those charges between 2001 and 2007. I went back to them in 2007 and said that the increase still needed to be held off. The additional charges on the use of electricity&#8212;the distribution use of system and transmission use of system charges, or DUOS and TUOS&#8212;would have hiked the cost to the factory by 46%. The Minister went back again in 2007 and made sure that those charges were held off. That saved the company an additional payment of &#163;212,000 for the next four years.Unfortunately, in 2013 the bullet had to be bitten. The Minister wrote to me to say:&#8220;Article 5 of Directive 2003/96/EC (&#8216;Restructuring the Community framework on the taxation of energy products and electricity&#8217;) dictates that the lower rate of CCL for supplies of natural gas in Northern Ireland must end at 31 October 2013.&#8221;As a result, the company saw its electricity prices go from &#163;1.2 million to more than &#163;2 million a year.No company can sustain that level of increase. That was not the fault of the Northern Ireland Government or the lobbying by local politicians who were working with the companies. It was not the fault of Invest Northern Ireland, which was campaigning hard behind the scenes for a change in policy. It is a national issue that must be addressed.The hon. Lady has read my mind. On 25 November 2013, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers) visited the plant at my invitation. She met the plant owners and recognised the huge issue of electricity costs. The suggestion made at that meeting was that because Michelin has plants in Scotland and England, as well as Northern Ireland, a united front was needed from the Scottish Secretary, the Northern Ireland Secretary and the Business Secretary to ensure that some special pricing code was put in place to assist the company. I put that point in writing to the company, saying that&#8220;we should make a very direct approach at Cabinet level with the help of the Secretary of State and our own Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment along with other Michelin Plants in the United Kingdom for a special case for a high energy user like Michelin to have some sort of special status when it comes to the cost of energy use.&#8221;I am glad to say there was a response from central Government: the Energy Intensive Industries initiative, which the Prime Minister introduced a short while ago. In an answer to a question put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) in Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time just last week, the Prime Minister indicated that EII is something companies such as Michelin should look at. I seized on EII some time ago. I wish the Prime Minister had not used that argument, because Michelin, by its structure, is actually excluded from benefiting from EII. EII is framed so narrowly that one of the single largest energy users is actually excluded from using it.Michelin has explained to me in some detail that it would have to go away and re-establish itself as a company, and go through a lot of red tape, to have a chance of qualifying for EII. That would be quite difficult. I think the Minister would accept that the legal due diligence alone for a plc would be costly and put it out of remit.I wish I had another half an hour to agree in detail with my hon. Friend. I absolutely accept that there is a madness behind the policy that forces electricity generators to pay more for electricity generated by windmills and then sell it on to consumers. That is absolutely wrong.I want to salute the efforts of Invest Northern Ireland and its chief executive, as that organisation always gets it in the neck. On this occasion, it has got it in the neck from the usual suspects and critics in Northern Ireland who claim it is not doing enough. I know that behind the scenes the company, and the chief executive in particular, have worked their socks off to try to get investment in County Antrim. It is incredibly helpful. It is, effectively, trying to roll a massive boulder up a hill, fighting for jobs in a crowded space and against the many unfair competitive advantages of others.If devolution is to be sustainable, it must be given the tools to fight and to see its energy costs reduced for its employers. That can happen only if a decision is taken here to help us. We in Northern Ireland require a national response to these national issues. This is on a par with the 15,000 job losses at Tata and SSI in the north of England. For the devolved Government to begin to compete and to replace this number of manufacturing jobs, we need support from the Prime Minister, UKTI and the Business Secretary. We need them to pull with us, batting for Ulster and batting for jobs for us around the world, so that whenever UKTI or the embassies are open for trade missions in the east, the far east or the United States, they are not just thinking of mainland Britain but Ulster too, and asking how a particular proposal could fit in with the Northern Ireland region. We want to see more of that and hear more about it, because Northern Ireland is crying out for that assistance.I call on the Government to step up to the plate and tell us what they can do. We have a stable regime and a highly educated young workforce with advanced skills, and we are a cheaper region to invest in.Motion lapsed (Standing Order No. 9(3)).Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.&#8212;(Jackie Doyle-Price.)I believe that Parliament should be in the business of giving people reason to live, not of creating laws that facilitate and accelerate people&#8217;s death. I say that with respect to those who have today given their own personal, trying and solemn examples, but I believe that the balance is all wrong in this Bill and that is why I will vote against it.We all know that it is not necessary to change the law in order to have dignity in death. That has existed from the very beginning of time. Indeed, it is in the natural order of things.I understand what pastoral care is like. I grew up in a manse. People would come every day to my father&#8217;s manse and witness people with illnesses and sicknesses who needed to be comforted.I also have a more personal story to tell. A year ago to this day, my father passed away, and tomorrow we will celebrate his anniversary. Eighteen months prior to that, he had been in hospital. He had suffered a very serious illness and ended up on a life support machine. On his fifth day on that life support machine, the doctors indicated to us, &#8220;Look, your father&#8217;s probably going to die in the early hours of the morning. You should prepare yourselves and be ready for the eventuality.&#8221; We did. We prepared his funeral. We sat as a family and talked about what we should do over the next few days.That night, amazingly, my dad sat up in bed and demanded a cup of tea. He went on to enjoy another hearty year, and we went on to enjoy his company and lovely presence for another year. We planned his funeral with him, and it was a very different plan&#8212;it was noted publicly for being very different&#8212;from ours. Some people may say, &#8220;We have a right to do this and to tell people, &#8216;It&#8217;s now time: this person is now a burden on society&#8217;,&#8221; but that is not what we as legislators and as a Parliament should be doing. We should be taking stock and saying, in his voice, &#8220;No.&#8221;I commend the speech of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (David Warburton). I have spent a career doing what a lot of people told me I could not do, and I shall certainly continue to do so. I wish him well as he fills the big shoes of his predecessor. I hope things go well for him in this House.I welcome the aspirations set out in the Budget statement. I believe that this Government are committed to balanced growth, to increased productivity and living standards and to make work pay. I welcome, too, the 2% commitment to defence spending. That is most welcome as something for which we campaigned strongly during the election campaign.The Budget missed many points that the Government could have delivered, but I welcome the ongoing commitment to reduce corporation tax. That is a welcome stance, as I believe in a low-tax economy, which I believe drives jobs and employment. This also sends a powerful message to the Northern Ireland Executive&#8212;that as the Government here on the mainland continue to reduce corporation tax, Northern Ireland is missing the opportunity, every day that passes, to reduce its corporation tax. We have the right and the opportunity to control it completely&#8212;to reduce it to a very low level indeed or to remove it entirely. I think that the Northern Ireland Executive has been sent the message that they should get their skates on and reduce corporation tax as a matter of urgency. In my view, it should be lower than the 12.5% that is the current rate in the Republic of Ireland, our southern competitor, but we should certainly get our skates on, given what the national rate will be by 2020 if the Chancellor continues to have his way. The cost of reducing our corporation tax will be considerably less as a result of the Budget: Northern Ireland will be saved tens of millions of pounds a year, and that in itself is welcome.I am, however, concerned about the high rate of personal income tax throughout the United Kingdom. According to statistics from Christian Action Research and Education, one-earner families pay a third more tax than families in all the other richest countries in the world, and the tax bill of United Kingdom households with full-time mums is the highest in the world.Other taxation issues also need to be addressed. The Budget statement made no mention of the impact of high energy prices, which could potentially drive jobs out of Northern Ireland. They are being fuelled by anenvironmental tax which is set to increase from &#163;5.6 billion to &#163;16.1 billion. That will be very bad for Northern Ireland. My constituency contains one of the largest employers in the country, Michelin Tyres, which is a high energy user. Following the Budget, I received a letter from the company saying that energy pricing tariffs in Northern Ireland were the second most expensive in Europe, and that the cost was having a serious impact on Northern Ireland businesses. While the national Government here are holding off in regard to certain payments, I agree with the company that Northern Ireland&#8217;s renewables obligation certificate system for onshore wind could be seriously detrimental to our businesses.The Government did not take the opportunity to reduce VAT on tourism, which is one of our key employers, and drives between &#163;400 million and &#163;500 million into the local economy. We currently pay 20%, while our neighbour pays only 9%.As for the welfare reform changes, I welcome the reduced cap, but I am concerned about the different cap levels in different parts of the United Kingdom. The cap is being regionalised in favour of London, and I think that that is wrong. I believe that there should be a universal reduction.The welfare changes must now be implemented at Stormont. We are currently experiencing considerable delays. As we discuss the impact of the Budget on a devolved part of the United Kingdom, we should recognise that the crisis that Northern Ireland is facing could cause that devolved institution to crumble. The Government should convey that message, and prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario of a collapse of devolution in Northern Ireland as a result of the inability of certain politicians to do their job, to count, and to secure a settlement on welfare reform.I beg to move,That this House has considered the case of Colin Worton and compensation following an acquittal.The case of Colin Worton is an indictment of the justice system and how it operated in Northern Ireland. I ask Members to cast their minds back 32 years, to when Northern Ireland was in the midst of the troubles. At that time, a Roman Catholic workman, Adrian Carroll, was murdered, gunned down in the streets of the city of Armagh. That was an injustice that has not been properly addressed. In fact, 32 years ago, a double injustice was done, when Colin Worton, a serving solider in the Ulster Defence Regiment, was arrested, held, questioned and subsequently charged. He was held behind bars for several years awaiting trial, where the case was thrown out because it was deemed by the judge that the statement he had made had come about under severe duress.That injustice affected Colin Worton&#8217;s entire life and all his family. His father had already lost one son to terrorism, gunned down in the Kingsmill massacre. He then effectively lost his other son, Colin&#8212;a man who was serving Queen and country&#8212;along with Colin&#8217;s good character, through a smear and a charge that he was somehow a terrorist.My hon. Friend makes an important point. I commend his actions. He has campaigned for years on this case and has tried to help Colin in the many different forums in which he has been a representative. He has also lobbied constantly and, more important, kept applying for a debate as well. It was really only the luck of the draw, so to speak, that my name came up. I am delighted that he has been so supportive of this case over the years.As I said, Colin Worton never had his name cleared properly. I welcome the statement of the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, Minister Ford, of a couple of months ago that&#8220;there is no stain on Colin Worton&#8217;s character&#8221;,but unfortunately those words are not matched by actions. If there is no stain on the character of a soldier, why for the past 32 years has it been impossible for him to get back his job in the Ulster Defence Regiment? If there is no stain on his character and he can hold his head high, as he has been told by officialdom, why does he not have the simple right to have his job back, to serve his Province and his people?I will tell the House why: because there is a stain, which has prevented him from going back to his job and from having a proper income-generating life. As a result, he has been forced to do menial jobs around the country, because people whisper behind their hands, &#8220;He&#8217;s the boy who was part of that murder team that killed an innocent man.&#8221; We need to nail that, and nail it loud and clear. We need to point out that if there is no stain on the character of Colin Worton then, given that he has not been able to have his job back for the past 32 years, he must now be properly compensated under existing mechanisms. I will come to those mechanism, because the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland could use his powers in a discretionary way, and he should be encouraged by this House and this Government to do so. It is no way to treat a citizen of the United Kingdom and former soldier of Her Majesty&#8217;s forces. In essence, compensation should be paid to Colin Worton for his loss.The effect of wrongful arrest and imprisonment&#8212;wrongful waste of life&#8212;on any person is devastating, and that situation is always wrong. But when a person sees three of his colleagues having their convictions overturned on appeal and being given substantial compensation&#8212;rightly so; those three were all also soldiers in Her Majesty&#8217;s forces, I should add&#8212;he must feel doubly indicted and abused. It seems he is not entitled to the same level of compensation or the same sense that not only has he got overturned something that was wrongly said about him, but the state that did that has been forced to pay for that injustice.According to the available information, previous Secretaries of State and the Northern Ireland Justice Minister have indicated that, under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, Mr Worton does not qualify for compensation. I believe that they are wrong in their interpretation of that section. I set that against the fact that we live in an era when the Northern Ireland Attorney General feels at liberty to recommend that there should be an amnesty system for terrorists to come forward to give evidence in historical cases without the risk of being prosecuted; it simply beggars belief that a man at the opposite end of the spectrum&#8212;a former soldier who has been told there is no stain on his character&#8212;is being punished for something he did not do in that same era. He is forced to live a life of little opportunity, with the stigma of a horrific murder latching itself to his hip despite his absolute innocence.For Colin Worton to be told he falls outside the boundary of entitlement to compensation is wrong. The Northern Ireland Minister and the numerous Secretaries of State who come to Northern Ireland,should be encouraged to themselves encourage the devolution system to demonstrate the flexibility that it should have by addressing this particular injustice.At Mr Worton&#8217;s initial trial, his so-called confession statement was deemed inadmissible as evidence because it had been extracted under extreme duress. Let me put that in the language of the street. Mr Worton had the crap kicked out of him until he said the right things. Once he had said them and had signed the right confession, he was going to be banged up in jail. That is what happened to three of his colleagues. Fifteen years later, those convictions were overturned and they were released. When Mr Worton&#8217;s case came to trial in 1986, the judge was so perplexed by what he saw that he immediately deemed that Mr Worton&#8217;s statement could not be used as evidence, and on that basis told Worton to leave the court room&#8212;he was a free man. That did nothing to compensate for the two and a half years he spent lingering in jail for the trial, and it did nothing to compensate him for the loss of his promising career in the services. It did nothing to compensate him for the now decades of financial loss and it certainly did not clear his name. When he left that courtroom, in the eyes of the general public, he got off. They thought, &#8220;He got off&#8212;he was lucky.&#8221;That, unfortunately, has been the character of the case. There has been a very deliberate effort by many to continue to perpetuate the myth that these were lucky men. But no; these were innocent men, who were wrongly tried and wrongly convicted, and who eventually&#8212;thankfully&#8212;had their convictions overturned. There needs to be recognition of the serious nature of the case and of the fact that the overturning of the original trial of what became known as the UDR Four meant that convictions against soldiers in Northern Ireland for crimes halved. So few were ever convicted, and so few were ever involved in anything wrong, that this case was held up as an example of how soldiers had been involved in wrongdoing. When the case was thrown out, it halved the number of cases that could be pointed at to show that soldiers had done something wrong in Northern Ireland. That is why it is such an important example and such an important case, and why it has to be put right.A false confession made under interrogation, of course, implies improper behaviour by the individuals who extracted it. There was therefore a &#8220;serious default&#8221;, or rather a lack of those words coming from the judge&#8217;s mouth. The judge should have recognised that that &#8220;serious default&#8221; was in place, and if he had recognised that and said so when he put Worton out of the trial, Worton would have been granted compensation. However, because of the lack of those two words, he did not get compensation under the scheme.These are the words of the Justice Minister in Northern Ireland in a recent debate:&#8220;The general principle behind any payment of compensation is to make reparation where the normal machinery of justice has demonstrably failed the accused person.&#8221;In that debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly, 54 Assembly Members agreed that Worton should be compensated, whereas 27 Assembly Members did not. On that basis, there is a strong momentum to ensure that Mr Worton is properly compensated for this injustice.If he had been compensated in the 1980s when it happened, the matter would have gone away a long time ago.It says something of the man himself that he has continued to campaign tirelessly, year in, year out, decade in, decade out, to clear his name, because he is so incensed by what has happened to him. His family are equally incensed, and rightly so. Mr Worton has, in my view, conducted this business well and in a dignified manner. He has never stopped in his mission to have his name properly cleared and to have compensation. This is a man whose brother was murdered by the Provisional IRA, and who served in the Ulster Defence Regiment to help protect the Province and its people he so dearly loved. This is a man who had every reason to hate the Irish Republican Army for what they did, yet he worked on behalf of this Government&#8217;s security forces to help bring peace to Northern Ireland.Mr Worton&#8217;s father died having had one son murdered by terrorists and another one labelled a murdering terrorist. That injustice to his entire family must be properly addressed. That is why I am pleased that this matter has got the Floor of this House and pleased that it is recognised nationally that there is an issue which the devolved Administration in Northern Ireland must address expeditiously. It has been long enough in the making. They have time now in which they could address this case.I thank my right hon. Friend for making that point. He really gets to the crux of the matter: how we find the mechanics to solve this issue? How do we ultimately address it?I hope that the Whips Office carries back to the Northern Ireland Office a very strong message. Heads have to be put together between the Northern Ireland Office and the Justice Ministry to find a way of resolving this legacy case once and for all. Resources are found for all sorts of things in Northern Ireland, and indeed, for all sorts of things across the United Kingdom. It would be very easy to solve this matter, and I hope that that message is carried back. My right hon. Friend has probably predicted the entirety of the speech of the Minister today. I understand why Ministers&#8217; could be tied to such a degree, but there has to be some recognition that the devolved Administration have flexibility. They have the ability to find a mechanism&#8212;a special measure&#8212;through which they could address this case. I hope that they do. I hope that they are given the encouragement, and, if you like, the cover to allow them to act in this way, sure that what they are doing is right and what they are doing is proper.I should like to start by congratulating you on your successful election yesterday to the post of Chairman of Ways and Means, Mr Deputy Speaker.In the debates on the Queen&#8217;s Speech, I have heard &#8220;oneness&#8221; and &#8220;togetherness&#8221; mentioned on a number of occasions. That is music to my ears as a Unionist. I feel very much a part of this nation and I want to ensure that its economy grows with a spirit of togetherness. Binding us more closely into the Union will bring us closer together, allowing us to share our strengths and ensuring that our weaknesses are not made greater. Those concepts of oneness and togetherness are therefore welcome and heartening; they give us a sense of belief in the potential of what this new Government are offering us.I am a proud to be a Member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, and from North Antrim, and as such I am bound to ask what the Queen&#8217;s Speech will specifically mean to my constituents, my people and my community. In the last Parliament, I welcomed the fact that the Government put their neck on the line and pursued a change in corporation tax specifically for Northern Ireland. They gave us the power to reduce our corporation tax rate, and I hope that the Assembly will use that power wisely and allow us seriously to compete with the nation with which we share a land border&#8212;the Irish Republic&#8212;whose corporation tax rate stands at 12.5%. I hope that the Assembly will take up that challenge and make that change, and I welcome the fact that Westminster gave us that power.There are other things that this Government could do to enable Northern Ireland to increase its economic competitiveness and to be a stronger part of this nation. The tourism sector provides an example. I have the joy of having the Giants Causeway in my constituency. It is one of the finest natural locations for people to visit; indeed, it is the single largest visitor attraction on the entire island of Ireland. I welcome many people there each year; I just wish that they were all my voters. That attraction creates and stimulates employment and opportunity. Attracting more tourists to Northern Ireland is therefore part of the business plan for our country.We currently have 60,000 people directly employed in the tourism sector, and a &#163;1 billion a year spend in a country with a population of 1.7 million. That comprises &#163;600 million being brought in by visitors to Northern Ireland and spent there, plus &#163;400 million going out with people leaving Northern Ireland for tourism purposes. The Government could help by reducing VAT in the tourism sector, and I hope that they will look at my proposal, possibly even before 8 July. I would welcome that change, which would help small businesses in the sector.I would also like to see air passenger duty removed altogether from domestic flights. The Government kindly reduced it for long-haul flights, which helps the airport in South Antrim, the constituency next door to mine, but I would like to see it removed from local flights. If you are really serious about togetherness, don&#8217;t tax us when we fly to our nation&#8217;s capital!The Government have done well in appointing a Minister for the northern powerhouse. Speaking as someone who represents the real northern powerhouse in our country&#8212;Northern Ireland&#8212;I hope that that Minister&#8217;s remit will be extended to allow him to look at the economic opportunities that flow from Ulster. Indeed, he could link in with Invest Northern Ireland and withour tourism, enterprise and trade to create great connectivity between the economic powerhouse being built in the north of England and the economic power base that could exist in Northern Ireland. That was certainly one of our priorities in the election campaign, and I look forward to that link being created.The largest economic sector in Northern Ireland is agri-foods, and I hope that the Government will take a serious look at the opportunities created by our exporting our finest product&#8212;namely, food produce. One possibility could involve agricultural licences for the export trade with Asia, the far east and the middle east. Restrictions on exports are incredibly high at the moment, and I hope that our Government will make a serious effort to say to China and the middle east in particular, &#8220;Here is an opportunity for us to increase our trade and expand our agri-foods industry in Northern Ireland.&#8221; I hope that the Government will consider that opportunity.In the weeks ahead, Northern Ireland will face a political crisis relating to welfare reform. I hope that the Government recognise that they have a serious responsibility to hold firmly to the line that the Prime Minister expressed yesterday when he said that we want to see the full implementation of the agreement that was struck in Belfast in the latter part of last year. Only by having economic sense and recognising that we cannot spend beyond our means will we be able to take Northern Ireland out of the way of the economic harm that those opposing welfare reform in our country wish on our land.At the outset, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) on securing this very important debate and on introducing it in such a powerful way."},
    {"label":"Pat Doherty","value":"Go raibh maith agat a Cheann Comhairle. This is indeed my last contribution to the House as a Member and it is an honour to do so in my capacity as Deputy Chair of the Committee for Regional Development. It is also an honour to have served under such a fine Chairman as Jimmy Spratt and I say that with all sincerity. At the outset I thank the Chair and my Committee colleagues for their humour and hard work and their dedication to the Committee. I also thank the Committee Clerk and his staff. I added that bit in myself Paul. I echo the Chair&#8217;s comments that it is unusual to see the Committee divide as members are genuinely united in their opinions on how we get the best for the North in transport roads rail and water. This was most evident in our recent visit to Brussels in respect of the TEN-T negotiations.I will try to curtail my comments as much as possible because I am aware that other business has to be heard in the House. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development I voted for this prayer to be brought to the Floor of the House. As Deputy Chair I hope that I will reflect the opinions of all members of the Committee but at the same time I will indicate that the Committee position is as delivered by a majority of its members. I will refer to the Chair of the Committee&#8217;s introductory factual remarks about how we arrived at this position. This was not an easy speech for the Chair particularly given his personal views on the charges. As would be expected of our Chair those introductory remarks were honest and accurate. As has been heard the majority of Committee members respectfully beg to differ with his comments as a Member of this House.The Committee remains unconvinced of the motives for introducing these increased charges and it called for a strategic review of car parking. The Minister has not explained why after an initial significant reduction in penalties when the scheme was introduced in 2006-07 there has been a steady increase in the number of tickets since. Why is this the case? What research has been undertaken to explain that? If the research has been undertaken why has it not been presented to the Committee or the House?The Committee sees these increases as purely and simply to raise revenue. Although we acknowledged that no specific targets are defined in the contract it must be acknowledged that often the policy is made up of what is not said rather than what is in writing. In this instance the enforcement organisation is placidly being instructed to raise an additional &#163;2&#183;5 million a year in ticket revenue. That is between 27000 and 55000 additional tickets each year. Surely this will erode whatever little bit of discretion the wardens or redcoats have. I wholly agree with the Chair&#8217;s suggestion for a dual tariff and published protocol and this has been echoed by a number of Members in the debate. Such an action would bring a level of reassurance to the public and I fully endorse calls for the Minister to review those areas urgently.I do not intend to respond to all of the contributions in the debate but I will make reference to some of them. Cathal &#211; hOis&#237;n quite correctly talked about the pressure on small businesses and the effects on villages and small towns. Ross Hussey admitted to illegal parking but said that the fines were a critical component of enforcement. He liked the idea of the Minister rattling his sabre and I wondered where &#8220;beyond use&#8221; went to when he was talking about sabres.John Dallat expressed appreciation for the openness of the Minister. He said that it was ordinary people who were being targeted and pointed out the difference between fines and fees. He also cited the conduct of one red coat and blamed a cruel Executive that was pushing a kind Minister. Stewart Dickson said that it was about revenue-raising as opposed to improving parking etiquette. He suggested a two-tier system and said that &#163;60 plus discount was reasonable but not &#163;90. He asked the Minister to reconsider the two-tier system. Ian McCrea said that this was a difficult issue but supported the Minister. However he had sympathy with some people who were fined particularly those going to the hairdresser. [Laughter.]Se&#225;n Lynch said that it was a revenue-raising issue and that it was coming down heavily on ordinary citizens. He said that he gets heavy representation on the issue perhaps because his constituency office is beside a car park. He too admitted to illegal parking but said that he paid his fines. Roy Beggs said that no one liked to be fined but that some of the arguments being put were illogical. He noted that fines had not been increased since 2006. He said that if there were no car-parking attendants towns would be jammed up. He highlighted the need for road safety and asked what the alternative was. He said that it would not affect the Minister&#8217;s budget. He also said that he was very much attached to street lighting. [Laughter.]John McCallister took some issue with Sinn F&#233;in. He did not want on-street parking charges and said that Sinn F&#233;in&#8217;s position was illogical. He supported increases in the charges and dismissed other options as not being worked through. There was then quite an interruption from Basil which caused a bit of an uproar. I thought that he was slightly disrespectful to the Committee that had tabled the motion. John then returned to his point and quite forcefully made the point that &#163;45 was not that big a charge. It is to some people.David McNarry made a very measured contribution and thanked the Chair for the way in which the report was delivered to the House. He said that if the charge was increased by &#163;30 it would have a big negative impact on ordinary people and traders. He said that the Department cannot have it both ways and asked why the &#163;60 option was not working. He said that if it was not prayed against the measure would drive people out of town centres. He also said that it was essentially a fundraising measure.Minister Danny Kennedy thanked Members for their contributions. He restated the Department&#8217;s position and said that there was a need for a deterrent to get drivers to park legally. He said that people who flouted the law should pay more. He said that if the statutory rule were prayed against it would cost the Department &#163;7&#183;5 million over three years and that that money would have to be found by other means which he outlined. He said that the penalty could be avoided by drivers parking legally. He said that there was training and that protocols were in place and highlighted the fact that there will be discretion in how the charges are applied. He spoke correctly and very honestly about his dialogue with the Chair the Deputy Chair and the Committee. I appreciate that and thank him for it. He attempted to bring forward a new Sinn F&#233;in slogan &#8212; very badly I must say. [Laughter.] Nevertheless it was a genuine attempt. He said that the polluters should pay. He also said that we must live in the real world and that if we do not accept this and pray against it there could be further charges down the line.I hope that I have accurately reflected Members&#8217; views and the thoughts of the Committee. The Committee for Regional Development supports the motion.I would like to divert for a short while because this is my last speech in the Assembly. I want to thank you a Cheann Comhairle. I thank all the Speakers and Deputy Speakers &#8212; Cinn Chomhairle LeasChinn Chomhairle and Pr&#237;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle &#8212; from the time I have been here since 1998.

I speak as Deputy Chair of the Committee for Regional Development. I thank the Minister for bringing the economic strategy to the House.It is telling that transport measures are contained in the economic strategy in such categories as &#8220;Competing in the Global Economy&#8221; and &#8220;Economic Infrastructure&#8221; because that quite rightly elevates them to an appropriate level. The transport sector is a very important component of the economy as it impacts on the development and welfare of populations. When transport systems are efficient they provide economic and social opportunities and benefits that result in positive multiplier effects such as better accessibility to markets employment tourism and additional investment.As far back as 1994 the World Bank Group in a world development report noted that the provision of infrastructure services to meet the demands of businesses households and other users was one of the major challenges of economic development. It is therefore most welcoming to see transport infrastructure take a pivotal position in the strategy. I include the commitment to the abolition of air passenger duty as being a key ingredient of the transport mix.Central to that are the road and rail networks. They are paramount to facilitating transport and are the base of any developed economy as they constitute the heart of the supply chain. Roads are the crucial link between producers and their markets. The dense road network guarantees better access to customers. They are the backbone of the economy as they connect almost any location and guarantee cost-efficient delivery of goods and services and importantly transport of people.With the Ceann Comhairle&#8217;s permission I will divert for a moment to ask the House and the Executive to take on board that the constituency that I represent West Tyrone and the constituency that the Minister represents Fermanagh and South Tyrone do not have one yard of a rail system. Nevertheless the rail system will be key to facilitating access to major events such as the Irish Open the City of Culture and the Titanic celebrations. I therefore congratulate the Minister and her Executive colleagues for ensuring that investment in transport networks is included in the economic strategy. Investment in roads together with sustainable transport initiatives approaches &#163;1 billion.Obviously concerns that I raised during the debate on the Programme for Government remain valid particularly the reduction in capital funding for water infrastructure. Adequate investment in that area would also have met the objective of aiding the construction industry. However just as the Committee has called on the Department to develop road schemes to shovel-ready status should additional investment become available I also issue that challenge to NI Water. There is of course work to be done on its governance process which might result in efficiencies for reinvestment. That should be a priority particularly as the asset base will be increased should the measures for social and affordable housing in the economic strategy be implemented.I can only reiterate the importance of transport infrastructure in positioning the North in the global marketplace. The very significant investment in that is essential to kick-starting economic recovery. We have a strategy in place. Now we need to see its measures being enacted. I am content that I and my Committee colleagues are keen to work with the Minister for Regional Development to ensure that those measures are implemented.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the First Minister and the deputy First Minister for bringing this debate to the House. I speak today as the Deputy Chair of the Committee for Regional Development and base my comments on the Committee&#8217;s report &#8216;Response to the Consultation on the Draft Programme for Government 2011-15 the Draft Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland 2011-21 and the Draft Economic Strategy&#8217; which was published on 25 January this year. I will restrict my comments to those relating to the motion.The Programme for Government contains six commitments that fall to the Department for Regional Development. The first commitment is to progress the upgrade of key road projects and improve the overall road network to ensure that journey times on key transport corridors reduce by 2&#183;5% against the 2003 baseline by March 2015. The second is to ensure that there will be no additional water charges during this Programme for Government period. The third is to upgrade the Coleraine to Derry railway line. The fourth is to invest over &#163;500 million to promote more sustainable modes of travel. The fifth commitment is to create the conditions to facilitate at least 36% of primary-school pupils and 22% of secondary-school pupils to walk or cycle to school as their main mode of transport by 2015. The sixth is to maintain a high quality of drinking water and improve compliance with waste water standards by investing &#163;600 million in water and sewerage infrastructure. With your permission a LeasCheann Comhairle I will briefly address each commitment.I am delighted that there has been significant progress towards the first target &#8212; the progressing of key road projects &#8212; following the announcement of &#163;330 million &#163;105 million and &#163;57 million to the A5 A8 and A2 networks respectively. That will make a major contribution to the economy in the North as a whole and in the case of the A5 to the north-west in particular. It is estimated that the multiplier ratio is 3:1 meaning a financial injection of nearly &#163;1 billion. Although that is welcomed by all it is important to note that the target to reduce journey times by 2&#183;5% against the 2003 baseline was deficient in two ways. First targets exist for the reduction of journey times through the upgrading of key roads while no targets are in place to improve public transport times where it is claimed that journey times are increasing. Secondly the reduction of 2&#183;5% was against a 2003 baseline rather than a more recent starting point. That was not seen as significantly challenging to the Department.The commitment to ensure that no additional water charges would be levied during this Programme for Government period was welcomed by organisations representing the public but caused concern to those charged with delivering and scrutinising the water and waste water targets. These concerns did not necessarily centre on the fact that charges would not be applied but on the governance processes resulting from NI Water being designated a non-departmental public body for accounting purposes. It was argued that that came with constraints that impact on NIW&#8217;s ability to deliver priority works and maximise efficiencies and performances for customers. In addition there was a concern that funding did not appear to be adequate with consequent risks for future levels of service and the potential for EU infraction. Undoubtedly those are serious concerns and the Committee will wish to receive the Minister for Regional Development and his officials to commence discussion on the governance arrangements of NIW in the very near future.The third pledge is to upgrade the Coleraine to Derry railway line. Again we have seen some early commitments to that upgrade with emergency remedial works being undertaken to ensure that an important section of the track is available for the majority of the City of Culture celebrations. I commend the Minister for Regional Development for his engagement with the Committee in that respect. We hope that the full upgrade can be completed as soon as possible bringing about further improvements and improved connectivity between the north-west and the remainder of the cities and towns in the North and in the South.The fourth commitment is to invest over &#163;500 million to promote more sustainable modes of transport. The Committee heard that there appeared to be a conflict between the sustainable transport objectives in the Programme for Government and those contained in major existing policy documents such as the regional transport strategy particularly with regard to the fact that the budget appears to be moving away from the 65:35 funding split between roads and public transport. It was suggested that only approximately 14% to 15% of the budget would now be available for investment in public transport and that the investment of &#163;500 million would be used to maintain passenger numbers at 77 million per annum. That target has been in place since 2008 and was said to be indicative of the fact that the Programme for Government merely sought to maintain the status quo and would not create the environment and circumstances that would bring about a significant modal shift away from cars to public transport.The fifth commitment seeks by 2015 to create the conditions to enable at least 36% of primary-school pupils and 22% of secondary-school pupils to walk or cycle to school as their main mode of transport. That is universally welcomed and the Committee was able to see the potential for such a target when it witnessed pupils at Gilnahirk Primary School take part in the Bike It programme. The one criticism of the target was that it restricted itself to the education sector and did not expand into for example the commute to work.The final target is to maintain a high quality of drinking water and to improve compliance with waste water standards by investing &#163;600 million in the water and sewerage infrastructure. I covered the concerns about the governance of NIW earlier and will not recount them again. However the levels of funding identified in the Programme for Government and ISNI caused grave concern as they will drop significantly up to and beyond 2015. Funding is currently at &#163;188 million per annum. However it will drop to &#163;167 million per annum by 2015 and will drop again to &#163;100 million per annum for the period up to 2021. It was estimated that it costs up to &#163;80 million per annum just to maintain the base asset and that leaves very little to invest in infrastructure particularly given the lack of opportunity to carry capital funding over the financial years.A number of respondents stated that the milestones and outcomes accompanying the commitments were not SMART and were vague and unambitious which would therefore lead to difficulty in assessing progress. Again it was felt that an opportunity had been lost to use appropriate milestones to drive the Programme for Government commitments resulting in a tick-box exercise rather than a meaningful analysis of progress. It was seen as a priority that clear measurable and ambitious targets were needed for each commitment. It was seen as important that the delegation of Executive commitments to individual departmental corporate plans should also result in meaningful measurable and ambitious targets and outcomes. The Committee for Regional Development &#8212;Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion. During the severe cold snap at the end of last year and the beginning of this year it was obvious that the measures in place to safeguard the water and heating supplies were inadequate as were the repair services.In parts of West Tyrone homes were without water and heating for weeks over the Christmas and New Year period. They included entire housing estates such as the Strathroy housing estate in Omagh where the water supply was completely cut off. That breakdown had the most profound impact on the most vulnerable people in the community particularly older people people with disabilities and households with young children. However I pay tribute to the local Housing Executive staff who worked closely with councils residents&#8217; groups and community leaders on the ground to try to minimise the impact.Not only were the local Housing Executive offices understaffed but the breakdown of the telecommunication system compounded an already dire situation. As a basic measure to safeguard water and heating supplies it would have been preferable in such a situation for tenants to deal directly with the approved Housing Executive contractor than to try to navigate through an entirely dysfunctional telecommunication system. In addition to the telephone systems collapsing communications with tenants were generally very poor. Many tenants did not have basic preventative information about how to avoid frozen pipes. Tenants lost thousands of pounds due to having inadequate insurance cover for the contents of their homes. It is essential that safeguarding measures are incorporated in the provision of information especially to the most vulnerable people.Finally when I spoke to local Housing Executive officers during the most recent cold snap they said that in many cases the same pipes and houses suffer those bursts almost every year. That should provide some intelligence and information that will enable us when we move forward to invest in repairs to do so with a more planned and phased approach.I beg to moveThat this Assembly supports the A5 dual carriageway project; recognises that it is essential to the economic regeneration of the north-west region; welcomes the financial commitment made by the Irish Government; and calls on the Minister for Regional Development to give an assurance that there will be no dilution of the project or delay in its completion.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I would like the debate to be constructive and supportive of the motion. I say that at the outset because I have noticed a tendency among some MLAs who while supporting the building of dual carriageways or motorways in their own constituencies which of course they have every right to do snipe at or undermine the proposed A5 dual carriageway project. If a motorway project is viable in any constituency the project should be argued on its merits and not by making undermining references to proposals in other constituencies particularly with regard to the A5 dual carriageway project.I am also mindful that while we are having this debate today a public inquiry is under way in various locations along the proposed route of the A5 dual carriageway. The public inquiry is scheduled to conclude in the autumn. I attended that inquiry to represent residents who will be affected by the proposed dual carriageway. In previous weeks and months I made representation for various farmers who would also be affected. While standing up for their rights as individuals I also made it clear that I was totally supportive of the plans for the A5 western transport corridor.I am aware that some of my colleagues who will speak in the debate will want to cover the historical situation that left Counties Fermanagh Donegal and Tyrone without any rail or motorway network. I want to focus not so much on the long-term history but on the more recent history in bringing the proposal forward.In July 2007 the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) noted the Irish Government&#8217;s intention to make available a contribution of &#163;400 million to help fund the major road works programme in the North providing dual-carriageway-standard routes to serve the north-west gateway and on the eastern seaboard corridor between Belfast and Larne. The Executive confirmed their agreement in principle to taking these two major road projects forward. The two Governments then agreed the following milestones for the A5 western transport corridor project: the preferred corridor was announced in late 2008; the announcement of the preferred route was made in mid-2009; and the draft statutory Orders and environmental statement were published in late 2010.The North/South Ministerial Council subsequently agreed a further schedule of milestones and anticipated payments from the Irish Government to the Consolidated Fund. The Council agreed an A5 western transport corridor project management structure which set up a cross-border steering group an A5 technical group and an A5 project team. The cross-border group reports regularly to the North/South Ministerial Council transport sector and plenary meetings.In November 2007 Roads Service appointed consultants. It then moved forward with a novel idea of the selected procurement process which adopted an early contractor involvement. That brought the contractors&#8217; procurement phase of the project ahead of the statutory procedures process thus removing about nine months from the overall project delivery time frame. It also allowed the contractors to provide valuable input to the design and to provide advice and costs on construction-related issues.I wish to relay to the House the strategic and policy context framework that advised this project as we moved forward. The long-term vision for transportation in &#8216;Shaping Our Future&#8217; the regional development strategy 2015 is:&#8220;To have a modern sustainable safe transportation system which benefits society the economy and the environment and which actively contributes to social inclusion and everyone&#8217;s quality of life.&#8221;Other strategic documents have also projected visions: the regional transportation strategy 2002-2012; the regional strategic transport framework transport plan 2015; the Programme for Government and the investment strategy; and the investment delivery plan for roads. The Programme for Government and the investment strategy were agreed by the Executive at their first Programme for Government and associated Budget meeting in 2008. They also endorsed a revised 10-year investment strategy covering the period 2008-2018. Very clearly in the middle of that was the proposal to upgrade the A5 western transport dual carriageway to a very modern standard.I have quite deliberately gone through all of the mechanisms that led to this proposal. I also clearly anchored it in joint decisions that were made by the Executive and the Irish Government and in what is contained in the Programme for Government and the strategic investment strategy. I did all that because it is a huge project that highlights as its main objectives the need for improvements in road safety in the road network in the North and in North/South links and the need for a reduction in journey times along the A5 western transport corridor. It also highlights the need for increased overtaking opportunities for motorists along the route and for the final proposal to be developed in light of safety economic environmental integration and accessibility considerations.The issue of safety is a huge one &#8212;Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am mindful of the time. I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate. The Assembly Commission has made recommendations in the report that will put in place the necessary governance accountability and transparency measures to ensure public confidence in the financial services support systems in the Assembly.I am pleased that Members have again confirmed their agreement to the establishment of an independent financial review panel which when established will determine all issues relating to Members&#8217; pay pensions and financial support. I will seek to address the issues that were raised during the debate and if Members feel that I have not covered them all I am more than happy to write to them.Mr Weir who is a member of the Commission summed it up very well when he talked about putting our house in order. That phrase has carried us through all this business. He talked about support for the principles and ironing out any flaws in the system.Rev Bob Coulter spoke of his length of time on the Commission. It has been a lengthy period and time well served. He paid tribute to the Commission and the secretariat and he reminded the media &#8212; I support him in this &#8212; that MLAs turned down an increase of up to &#163;10000. That should be well and truly noted. He committed himself to the principles of transparency and accountability.Mr Pat Ramsey said that it is the Commission&#8217;s third attempt to get the report through the Assembly. He too supports those principles particularly the Nolan principles which he highlighted. He focused particularly on new arrangements for the independent evaluation of constituency offices and the fact that those offices must be to the highest standards.Mr Trevor Lunn stood in for Mr Sean Neeson. I hope that Sean is recovering from his illness. Mr Lunn spoke of transparency accountability and openness. He queried certain arrangements. As he is not a Commission member I understand why he is not fully familiar with the details. I propose to respond to his detailed queries in writing.Paul Maskey said that he welcomed the report on behalf of Sinn F&#233;in. I am glad that he said that. There would have been some difficulty had he said something else. He committed himself to transparency and accountability as other Members have done. He supports the report in its entirety.I am mindful of the time. The Assembly Commission is confident that the report&#8217;s recommendations will enhance existing governance arrangements and will ensure that robust systems are in place for Members to carry out their duties as public representatives effectively. I commend the report to the House.Question put and agreed to.Resolved:That this Assembly approves the Assembly Commission&#8217;s report on the financial support and pensions for Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (December 2010); and makes the Northern Ireland Assembly (Members&#8217; Expenditure) Determination 2010.I beg to moveThat this Assembly approves the Assembly Commission&#8217;s report on the financial support and pensions for Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (December 2010); and makes the Northern Ireland Assembly (Members&#8217; Expenditure) Determination 2010.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I move the motion on behalf of the Assembly Commission and during the debate I will speak on its behalf. I will start by providing Members with some background information on the genesis of the Assembly Commission report which makes interim changes and improvements in governance pending the establishment of the independent financial review panel.In 2007 prior to the restoration of devolution and the re-establishment of the Commission the Secretary of State wrote to the chairperson of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) to seek its agreement to conduct a review of the existing structure for salaries expenditure and pension benefits payable to members and office holders of the Assembly. In June 2007 the newly appointed Commission engaged with the SSRB to initiate the independent review under agreed terms of reference. The SSRB consulted with Members of the Assembly through a variety of qualitative methods during 2007 and 2008. It employed the Hay Group as consultants to look in detail at the roles of MLAs Ministers and office holders in the Assembly to assess the respective job weights. The SSRB then completed its report in November 2008 and the Commission initially considered the review recommendations at its meeting on 13 January 2009.The final report made 25 recommendations on pay pensions and expenditure for Members of the Assembly. In addition to the recommendations that were outlined by the SSRB the Commission also considered issues referred to it as identified in the fourth and fifth reports in 2009 from the Committee on Standards and Privileges. The Committee&#8217;s relevant recommendations were in relation to the Assembly&#8217;s rules governing the use of Members&#8217; financial support in the areas of accommodation and dual mandate. We are keen to ensure that a best-practice approach is applied to our financial systems and we will continue to monitor the ongoing developments in other places.All party leaders were then consulted on the report. However the report was withdrawn in November 2009. In December 2009 it was agreed that further consideration would be required on a range of possible options to progress the recommendations set out in the Commission&#8217;s report on pay pensions and financial support for Members of the Assembly. Additionally there was a consensus that further meetings with party leaders would be helpful in setting out a way forward. It was agreed to take forward a further report that excluded any reference to pay arrangements for Members and to leave those decisions for an independent financial review panel upon its establishment. At that point the necessary process was initiated for the establishment of the independent financial review panel. I will focus on that matter in more detail in a moment. The report brought forward options for changes to the resettlement allowance but was withdrawn pending further discussion with parties.The Assembly Commission has agreed a range of measures to ensure that the Assembly has arrangements in place that effectively and fairly support MLAs in carrying out their duties. To further ensure good governance transparency and accountability the Commission also commenced publication of Members&#8217; expenses on a quarterly basis releasing information back to 2003.The report that we are debating today has been developed following extensive consideration and consultation. It proposes a total of 17 recommend&#173;ations across three main sections. The key issues are the adoption of the 10 principles the establishment of an independent financial review panel and enhanced governance and expenditure issues for Members. I will focus briefly on each section and the main recommendations that are being proposed.Section 3 of the report relates to the adoption of the 10 principles that were developed in consultation with party leaders. The Commission wholly supports the adoption of the 10 principles to underpin the basis on which expenditure is paid to MLAs. We have proposed a methodology for the application of the principles and provided detail on the approach to dealing with any potential breaches of the rules on the claiming and use of expenses. I am sure that Members will agree that the principles provide a sound basis for underpinning the financial support regime for MLAs and for greater transparency and accountability.Section 4 of the report relates to the establishment of an independent financial review panel to determine all aspects of financial support for MLAs. During discussions with party leaders there was a unanimous view that the future determination of salaries pensions and financial support should be delivered by an independent mechanism. To allow for the establishment of the body amendment of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was required. In April 2010 at our request the Assembly Members Bill was passed at Westminster. The Assembly Members (Independent Financial Review and Standards) Bill was then jointly drafted by the Assembly Commission and the Assembly Committee on Standards and Privileges. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a panel to determine the pay pensions and other financial support for Members of the Assembly. The Bill also provides for the establishment of the post of an Assembly Commissioner for Standards.The Assembly Members (Independent Financial Review and Standards) Bill is currently progressing through the House its Second Stage having been taken on Tuesday 23 November 2010. An Ad Hoc Committee has been established to deal with the Bill. Committee Stage began on 24 November 2010 and the estimated date for Consideration Stage is the week commencing 31 January 2011.Section 5 of the report proposes a total of 15 recommendations in relation to entitlements and the governance of expenditure incurred by Members. This section covers an array of improvements to our existing services including revisions to the terminology used in existing regulation proposed changes to the calculations used to determine a number of our existing allowances and the enhancement of our governance structures. The Assembly Commission is not recommending any changes to the current arrangements for the pension scheme provided for in the Assembly Members&#8217; Pension Scheme 2008.The Commission has agreed that it would be appropriate not to take a view on certain recommendations detailed by the Senior Salaries Review Body in relation to dual mandates as the matter falls under the responsibility of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. However assuming that some dual mandates may continue until 2015 the Commission has proposed a series of related recommendations regarding claims under office cost expenditure and winding-up expenditure. Additionally in support of recommendations raised by the Committee on Standards and Privileges the Commission is also recommending the immediate development of protocols for splitting expenses that are claimed by MLAs who are also MPs or councillors.In supporting Members in their role as employers the Commission is recommending the development of a capped bonus scheme for Members&#8217; support staff in defined circumstances in the event that Members choose to pay a bonus to their staff.The Commission considered the recommendation of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in its new expenses scheme for MPs and the restriction that it imposed on new MPs from receiving:&#8220;Staffing Expenditure for the salary of more than one employee who is a connected party.&#8221;It recommended that a similar approach be adopted in the Assembly.In the interests of accountability and of securing public confidence the Commission agrees with the recommendations of the SSRB that an independent assessment of MLAs&#8217; constituency offices should be undertaken by chartered surveyors to ensure that rental charges are reasonable for the area in which the office is located. The Commission also recommends that such independent valuations be sought before the renewal of the existing leases and before new lease arrangements or agreements are entered into. In line with the views of Assembly parties and as outlined in the rules that govern the expenses scheme for MPs the Commission agreed that no expenses should be claimed relating to a Member&#8217;s rental of a property where the Member or a connected party is the owner of the property or holds a lease in relation to the property in question. The Commission also recommends that all constituency offices comply with the statutory obligations that are placed on leased premises.The Commission also proposes changes to the calculations used to determine resettlement ill health retirement and winding-up allowances as proposed by the Senior Salaries Review Body. In line with the recommendation outlined by the SSRB the Commission also proposes that from the start of the next mandate the mileage allowance for business travel in excess of 10000 miles will be paid at 25p in line with the Income Tax (Earning and Pensions) Act 2003.If the Assembly accepts the recommendations it will improve its accountability and transparency to the general public; it will also increase public confidence in the governance of the Assembly. The Commission acknowledges the work of secretariat staff in preparing the report. I am aware that there has been much iteration in recent months and I also acknowledge the work and support of Commission members in a difficult and ever-changing area.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. When I first read the motion I was somewhat concerned by the fact that it appeared in the name of the First Minister. My concern was not alleviated when I heard that the Minister of Finance and Personnel will make the winding-up speech. Both Ministers should have declared a conflict of interest at the beginning of the debate.The motion should not be reduced to a debate about meal subsidies &#8212; it is much more fundamental. The First Minister said that it was about principle and that he did not want to be open to the accusation of putting pressure on the Assembly. I fear that that is exactly what he did. The Commission is the servant of the Assembly not part of the Executive and that distinction must be kept in mind. The Commission develops its budget based on its view of how it can best and most efficiently provide the services that the Assembly requires. In the interests of using public money properly like other non-Executive public sector entities it does so in frank and constructive dialogue with the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP). However the Assembly Commission is not part of the Executive. It is the servant of the Assembly. That clear distinction must be made at all times.Of course we are entirely aware of the economic situation that exists. The First Minister referred to the letter that went out in the Speaker&#8217;s name on 20 October.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Assembly Commission recognises the need to reduce the Assembly&#8217;s impact on the environment. The amount of paper used in the Assembly has been identified as an area where improvements need to be made. Members may be aware that the Assembly Commission recently endorsed a three-year sustainable development strategy with a supporting action plan a key theme of which is environmental impact reduction.In an effort to reduce the amount of paper used in Assembly Committee packs Committee meeting papers are printed and/or photocopied double-sided. In addition larger documents are either summarised or provided electronically in the vast majority of cases. Committee meeting papers are also available electronically for Committee members on request. The files and subject dividers of any returned Committee meeting packs are reused and the paper is recycled.The main initiative under consideration to reduce further the amount of paper used is the use of e-readers to enable Committee members to view Committee packs electronically. A pilot study on the use of e-reader technology in the Assembly was undertaken in 2009. Although it was recognised that the use of e-readers had potential difficulties were encountered with the then commercially available equipment. The Information Systems Office on behalf of the Assembly Commission continues to review technological advances in the emerging e-reader market and it is hopeful that an enhanced e-reader will become available that could be trialled at a later date. The successful introduction of an effective user-friendly e-reader would significantly reduce the amount of paper used in Assembly Committee packs.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. On a number of occasions the Assembly Commission has been briefed on the potential for a significant increase in the number of Bills introduced in the Assembly. The Commission was also briefed on the potential operational impacts of a heavy programme and on actions being taken by the secretariat to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to support the whole process. The secretariat has for example emphasised to Departments the importance of introducing Bills as early as possible in the final year of the mandate of this Assembly. Committee Chairpersons have also been encouraged to engage with Departments about priorities and the handling of Bills.The most immediate impact of the heavy programme of work will be on the Committee Office the Bill Office and the Legal Services Unit. However there is also likely to be a significant increase in the demand for Hansard services for Committee meetings and plenary sittings. A heavy work programme is also likely to place additional demands on Assembly Members in Committee and plenary sessions. To date the additional workload has been managed mainly through reviewing priorities in the relevant offices. However monthly updates on the programme of work and any associated resource issues have been requested. On the basis of those updates the Commission will ensure that action is taken to provide the necessary resources to support the Assembly in its role as a legislature.Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am a member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and I support the motion. The report contains many points that I agree with and I also agree with many points that have been raised in the debate. I want to concentrate on two issues.First it emerged during the inquiry that there was a huge dependence &#8212; an overdependence in my opinion &#8212; placed on the Central Science Laboratory which is based in York. All the testing for Britain and Ireland has to go through that lab. Given the importance of agriculture in Ireland compared with its importance in Britain there is room for both jurisdictions to see whether they can develop a central science lab based on this island North or South. Agriculture is of massive importance to the island&#8217;s economy.Secondly I want to talk about co-operation between the North and the South or rather the lack of co-operation between DARD and DAFF."}
